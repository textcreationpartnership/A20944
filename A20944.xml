            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The happy raigne of the late Queene ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH will furniſh vs, with a faire example thereof, who notwithſtanding the excommuniations of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fift, by whom England was interdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, ſhe long time enioyed a Peace without any diſturbance or interruption; and a proſperity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt beyond example. And finally, when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to take her to peace, and to gather her to his reſt: many ſuppoſed, that the end of her life, would be a beginning of troubles, and confuſions in England; and thereupon the opinions and feares were diuers, according to the diuerſitie of mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. For the Engliſh that were of the Romane Church attentiue and heedy to all occaſions, had conceiued hope of ſome great chaunge, whether it were that they were led into their hope vpon falſe grounds, or that after the death of a ſoueraine Prince better things are euer expected from the ſucceffor; or whether that ſuch as are diſcontented are euer
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:11466:8"/>deſirous of a change; ſo it was that in this <hi>Criſis</hi> of humours, the ſpirits of the Engliſh waued and floa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted betwixt hope and feare, till by the happy arriuall of IAMES the firſt, the lawfull Succeſſor; all things were appeaſed and cleared; euen as by the riſing of the Sunne miſts and fogges are diſperſed and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
                  <p>He in the ſweetneſſe and faireneſſe of his owne nature, enclined to giue content vnto all his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects with free liberty of conſcience: But this his in clination was ouer-ruled by neceſſity, when his wiſedome entred into conſideration, that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter now in queſtion was not onely Religion, but the peace of his eſtate, and the ſecurity of his crowne, for that it was a thing dangerous to permit publike Aſſemblies of ſuch perſons, as had taken Oath to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers then himſelfe; who hold that the Pope may pull downe Kings from their Thrones, and diſpenſe with ſubiects for the oath of their alleagea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer he called to his remembrance the kings his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, whom the Popes had reduced to extream ſeruitude, ſo farre as to make England parte of the Popes Demaines; and in Fee to the Church of Rome; and further to make it pay impoſt, and to cauſe the King to goe beneath his Legats, and to giue vp the Crowne into their handes. Theſe are conſiderations that one cannot ſquare or apply to thoſe of the Reformed Religion, which liue vnder a Soueraigne of a contrary profeſsion; for they take oath to no other, but to their Soueraigne Prince. They caſt their eyes vpon no Forrainer, they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11466:9"/>that it belongs not to the ſubiect out of the Religion of the Prince, to frame occaſions of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, making piety the match and kindler of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. We are ready to expoſe our liues for the defence of our King againſt whomſoeuer, though he be of our owne Religion; and whoſoeuer ſhould doe otherwiſe ſhould not defend Religion, but giue way to his owne ambitions, and ſhould draw a great ſcandall vpon the truth of the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding his Maieſtie hath vſed his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of the Romane Church in ſuch ſorte, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the liberty of publique exerciſe, he deſired to haue them in like and equall condition with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, being vnwilling to haue them diſturbed for matter of conſcience, knowing well, that Religion is not by force but by perſwaſion to take impreſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that in this caſe men will rather follow then be drawne, and that perſecutions begin when Arguments are at an end.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding this gentle proceeding, thoſe of the Church of Rome now fallen from great hopes, which they had imagined, turned their deſpaire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to choller and indignation; and thereupon plotted an enterpriſe, that ſhould haue enfoulded the King, the Queene, their children, his Maieſties Councell and the Parliament, in one and the ſame deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the plot was to make a Mine vnder the houſe of Parliament, and ſo to ſend the King and his royal family, with the chiefe of his Countrey to heauen by a new found way.</p>
                  <p>Hatred is an ingenious Miſtris of inuention, for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:11466:9"/>neyther ancient nor moderne Hiſtories can parallel this with any example: The Prince of the world re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued to our times, which are the very ſinke of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, ſomething more exquiſitely cruell and horrible, then euer before hath beene mentioned. In the meane time, through all their houſes, there was a certaine forme of prayer preſcribed by the Prieſts and Ieſuites, for the happy ſucceſſe of this enterpriſe; to whom the complices did mutually binde themſelues by oath, ſworne vpon the holy Sacrament, both for ſecrecie and perſeuerance in the deſigne. The Mine was already finiſhed, and the Gun-powder laid ready, and nothing wanting but the execution; when God, who (as he is himſelfe a King) ſo conſequently he is the protector of Kings, whom he hath eſtabliſhed; miraculouſly diſcouered this treaſon; the conſpiratours being taken, ſuffered according vnto law, and amongſt others two Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites <hi>Garnet</hi> and <hi>Ouldcorne;</hi> who are now inſerted into a catalogue of<note n="*" place="margin">It is a table printed at Rome, <hi>Anno</hi> 1608. <hi>apud Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Mauperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num &amp; Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Gruterum,</hi> dedicated to <hi>R.

                  <p>Leſſe cauſe would haue ſufficed an impatient King to haue exterminated all their complices, and to haue let looſe the raines of his iuſt anger, but hee with a rare example of clemency, ſuffered puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to paſſe no further, then to the principall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents, inuenting and framing to himſelfe Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Reaſons how he might pardon: he conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that Superſtition might alter, and ſtirre vp the mildeſt ſpirits, and was deſirous by pardoning the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:11466:10"/>wicked, to make them become good; and though he could not find cauſe in them why to pardon, he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it in himſelfe; for though they no way deſerued mercy, yet he ſhewed himſelf worthy of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in doing good to thoſe of ſo euill demerite.</p>
                  <p>He conſidered that God, whom hee repreſents; ſendeth raine vpon the Bryers and Thiſtles, as well as on fruit Trees, and makes the Sunne to riſe alike to the good and to the euill; or elſe it may be that his clemency was accompanied and aſsiſted with a neglect of his enemies; eſteeming many of them not worthy of his wrath.</p>
                  <p>But for the better preuenting of ſuch conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in future times, the Parliament, together with the King, framed a forme of Oath, to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to all his Maieſties ſubiects, which is to this effect: <hi>That they acknowledge</hi> IAMES <hi>the firſt, King of great Britaine for their lawfull King, and that the Pope cannot by any right whatſoeuer depoſe him from his Kingdomes, nor diſcharge his ſubiects of their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, nor giue them licence to beare Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: Alſo that notwithſtanding any Declaration or Sentence of Exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication made or granted, or to be made or granted against the ſaid King &amp; his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, they wil beare faith and true alleageance to him, his heyrs &amp; Succeſſors, &amp; him and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil defend to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt of their power againſt all attempts &amp; conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies whatſoeuer: And that they wil reueale al treaſons and trayterous Conſpiracies, which they ſhall know or heare of, againſt him or any of them.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:11466:10"/>which be excommunicated by the Pope, may be depoſed or murdered by their ſubiects: And that they beleeue, and in conſcience are reſclued, that the Pope hath no power to abſolue them of this Oath, or any part thereof. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all pardons and diſpenſations to the contrary. And that without any Equiuocation, mentall Euaſion, or ſecret Reſeruation whatſoeuer, they doe ſincerely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ſweare all theſe things, and doe make this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement heartely, willingly, and truely. So helpe them God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Oath being offered to thoſe of the Romiſh Church, diuers of them tooke it without difficulty; and amongſt the reſt <hi>Blackwell</hi> the Arch-Prieſt, who then was, and ſtill remaines in England.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things, being come to the knowledge of the Biſhop of Rome, <hi>Paul</hi> the fift, that raignes at this preſent, he diſpatches preſently for England, a breue, or as they terme it, letters Apoſtolique bearing date the two &amp; twentieth of September 1606. by which he declares. <hi>That this Oath cannot be taken with good conſcience, exhorting them rather to vndergoe all cruell torments whatſoeuer, yea Death it ſelfe, rather then to offend the Maieſtie of God by ſuch an Oath; and to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the conſtancy and fortitude of the other Engliſh Martyrs, willing them to haue their loynes girt about with verity, and to haue the Breſt-plate of righteouſnes and to take the ſhield of faith: That God that hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne this good worke, might finiſh it in them, who wil not leaue them Orphants, &amp;c. And finally willeth them exactly to put in practiſe, that which is commaunded in the Letters of</hi> Clement <hi>the eight his Predeceſſor,</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:11466:11"/>written to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>George Black well the Arch-prieſt of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:</hi> by which Letters all Princes of any Religion contrary to their owne, are excluded from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of England.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Letters being come into England, were not receiued by thoſe of the Romiſh Church, with ſuch reſpect as the Pope expected; for many iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them ridiculous, as exhorting them to ſuffer Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome for ill doing, ſince none can be a Martyr, but for hauing done well: As alſo for that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that this Oath is contrary to the Catholique faith, without telling why or wherefore; as likewiſe for that the exhortations of holy Scripture to ſhun vice, and to perſeuere in the profeſsion of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and to reſiſt the Diuell, are in this Papall breue drawne to a contrary ſenſe, to kindle ſedition, and to incite ſubiects to diſobedience. And aboue all, for that theſe Letters, ingaging the ſubiects to reuolt, doe neceſſarily plucke vpon them perſecution and the iuſt anger of their natural Prince, who being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to require any caution of them in any thing contrary to their beliefe, demaundeth no more of them but fidelity and ciuill obedience.</p>
                  <p>For theſe conſiderations ſome part of the Prieſts and Friers of England ſaid, that theſe Letters of the Pope were ſhufled in by their Aduerſaries, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Heretiques (for ſo they of their goodnes are pleaſed to tearme vs) to kindle the anger of the King againſt them, which was already prouoked by the plot of the Powder-mine, which onely fell out to ruine the vndertakers. By reaſon whereof, the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:11466:11"/>ſame Pope being aduertiſed, that through theſe doubts, whether they were true or fained, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his Letters were infringed; hee writ o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more expreſly, bearing date the three and twentieth of Auguſt, 1607. In which he ſeemeth to wonder that they any way ſuſpect the truth of the Apoſtolique letters,<note place="margin">Non ſolum motu proprio &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>To theſe letters (giuing the Alarums to rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) for their greater confirmation, were added the letters of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to <hi>George Blackewell</hi> the Arch-Prieſt. In which after he had put him in minde of their auncient acquaintance, hee greatly blameth him for taking the Oath, the which vnder colour of modifications hath no other aime or drift, but to transferre the authority of the Pope, the head of the Church, to a Succeſſor of HENRY the eight, &amp; by the examples of his Predeceſſors he exhorreth him conſtantly to defend the primacy of the Pope, whom he calleth the head of the faith.</p>
                  <p>But he ſheweth neyther what wordes or clauſes in this Oath are contrary to the faith of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, nor wherefore this Arch-Prieſt ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuſe to die, then to obliege himſelfe by Oath, to be loyall to his King in things meerly ciuill, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:11466:12"/>which no way meddle with the Primacy of the Pope: and yet this is the onely thing, whereof que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is made, and whereof prooſe is expected. Theſe letters, both of the Pope and Cardinall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fallen into the handes of his Maieſtie might wel haue kindled the anger of a very patient Prince and haue armed and ſtirred him vp againſt thoſe with whom theſe Papall letters were of more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, then eyther their faith to their King, or their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God. For what Prince can permit in his Kingdome ſubiects that acknowledge him not, or that to retaine their fidelity to the Pope, thinke themſelues bound to diſloyalty towards their King.</p>
                  <p>And yet notwithſtanding his Maieſtie herein contained himſelfe, and would not; that his mercy ſhold be ſurpaſſed, by their wickednes, ſo far that he hath rather chuſe to take in hand the pen, then the ſword, and hath ſtudied to inſtruct thoſe, whom he might iuſtly haue deſtroyed, deſiring more to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince them by reaſon, then to ouercome them by force <hi>Maluit ſanguinem ſuffundere, quam effundere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What would not hee doe for his faithfull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, that lets himſelfe downe ſo low to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? that laies aſide the quality of a Iudge, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an Aduocate: but he whom God hath lifted vp to a Soueraigne greatneſſe, neuer exalteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe higher then by humility.</p>
                  <p>This King then to refute theſe Papal Letters, and to iuſtifie what he had done, made a booke, entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>An Apologie for the Oath of Alleageance,</hi> but not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:11466:12"/>ſetting his name thereunto, for it was nothing to him vnder what title the truth appeared; ſo that his enemies might come to the knowledge of their fault. This was no combat of the ability of wit, but a meere manifeſtation of his innocency: But the ſtile of a King is hardly diſguiſed, for Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in more eleuated places, receiue nearer at hand the inſpirations from heauen. Their conceptions are as much aboue the vulgar, as their conditions, this onely thought, that they are GODS Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and that they exerciſe his iudgements, quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens their ſpirits with an extraordinary life and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour: beſides if it ſo happen that their youth hath beene dreſſed and ordered by ſtudy, and their iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments poliſhed by experience, as it hath happened to the King of great BRITAINE, why ſhould any body wonder, if their their ſpirits flye a pitch aboue ordinary?</p>
                  <p>This Royall Apologie hauing then bin knowne (as a Lyon by his clawes) ſtirred vp certaine En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh-men, and Italians to write againſt it, who (as this King elegantly ſaide) haue caſt lots vpon his booke, for that they could not part it, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons thereof are vnſeparably weaued together, but they not being able to bite his worke, barke at his perſon with an incredible impudence, ſo far ſome of them, as to equall themſelues with ſo great a Prince; and to compare him to <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. Such are the flowers of their diuelliſh Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorique; wherewith their writings are adorned, on whom the Apoſtle S. <hi>Peter</hi> in his ſecond Epiſtle,<note place="margin">

                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:11466:13"/>giueth this iudgement, calling them brute beaſts, led with ſenſuality; that deſpiſe gouernment, which are preſumptuous, and ſtand in their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and feare not to ſpeake euil of them which are in dignity; whereas the Angels which are greater both in power and might, gaue not rayling iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt them before the Lord. Then if it be ill done to ſpeake ill of a Pagan Prince, ſuch as in thoſe times all Monarches were; how much more of a Chriſtian King; and if Angels forbore ill ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Princes, how much more would it beſeeme men, and moſt of all their owne ſubiects?</p>
                  <p>But no more then the Moone is turned out of her courſe by the barking of Dogges, that looke vp to her; no more was the tranquility of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties ſpirit, by theſe outragious iniuries diſturbed, nor his reſolution diuerted from doing good to thoſe which bore him hatred. It is a poore and meane thing to tread vpon wormes. There is no glory in ouercomming ſuch people, of whom he is ſufficiently reuenged, by the griefe, and diſpleaſure which they ſuſtain in ſeeing that God hath bleſſed him, and highly exalted him. He would therefore haue contemned their ſleighting of him, &amp; would haue abſtained from refuting their calumnies by a ſecond writing, had it not beene in regard, not of them but of his people, and of his neighbours, and aboue all of the glory of God; for God hauing honoured him with the true knowledge of him, his Maieſtie would not permit that the enemies, as well of the Goſpel, as of his Crowne, ſhould find in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:11466:13"/>his perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any ſubiect or colour to defame the true religion: He is then by an admirable example con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the aduocate of Gods cauſe, &amp; by a ſecond booke, made in forme of a Preface to his former, hath fully and throughly iuſtified himſelfe. In which booke he diſcouereth the flights and backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnings of his enemies, repreſenting the vniuſtnes of their proceedings. He likewiſe maketh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of his Religion conformable to the holy Scriptures, and with a happy boldnes figures, and depaints the Biſhoppe of Rome and his Sea with liuely colours, borrowed from the Apocalips, and the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neuer was Table drawne with a more exact hand, or in liuelyer colours. Such is the Torrent of his eloquence, ſuch is the weight of his reaſons, ſuch is the linking together of his diſcourſe, ſuch the variety of his learning, and ſuch his Maieſty in all thinges, as hee may beſt iudge of it, who ſhall compare them with that puft-vp weakeneſſe of the Popes letters, and with the writing of his Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Oh happy eloquence, which being armed with power, is become the hand-maide of Gods word; the ſourſe and ſpring whereof, falling from high, are like to the waters of Silo, which water the City of our God. Hee doth truely exalt his Scepter, which layeth it downe at the foote of the Croſſe, and that placeth his height and greatneſſe beneath the reproch of the Sonne of God, he ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth his houſe, making his Cabinet a Temple for Diuinity, and a retrayt for holy Meditations.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:11466:14"/>Then as in ancient times, the earth was more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, when it was laboured by Kings, as though ſhe had taken pride to beare a crowned Plough, and to be tilled with a Triumphall Coulter. So it is to be hoped that Religion and Piety will abundantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, ſince Kings are become labourers in the Harueſt.</p>
                  <p>This latter booke then being come to ſuccour and helpe the firſt, did diuerſly ſtirre mens ſpirits, ſome with ioy, ſome with feare, ſome with hate, but all generally with admiration. The booke being little, it was giuen out we ſhould haue it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered within three dayes, and ſure their good will was not wanting, but they found it a harder mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then ſo, and that they were faine to take more time. For it was eight moneths after it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, before the firſt Anſweres came forth; and what kinde of Anſweres they were, God he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth.</p>
                  <p>One <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> was the firſt that like an <hi>Infant perdu</hi> of the Romiſh army, aduanced himſelfe. This Seraphicall Doctor, of the order of the <hi>Iacobins,</hi> or preaching Fryers, one of the moſt remarkeable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Sorboniſts,</hi> is of late through his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions negligence become the defender of the cauſe. And he now after eight moneths being in labour, hath brought forth a booke, which is not like to liue, becauſe of the vntimely birth; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede it had beene already extinct and dead, had not the greatneſſe of him againſt whom he writes kept it aliue; wherein he ſhewed a point of skill to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:11466:14"/>addreſſe himſelfe againſt a perſon ſo illuſtrious, that he might receiue ſome luſtre from his reflection. But thoſe that deſire to make themſelues knowne by the greatneſſe of their Aduerſaries, are alwaies ſuch as haue little in themſelues, why the world ſhould take note of them. This Doctor in his booke, handleth the King of great Britaine, as a Nurce doth her nurce-childe, who after ſhee hath dandled it, beates it, mingling curſtneſſe and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: For in humble termes hee wrongeth him, and giueth him reſpectfull lyes, flatters him with iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, accuſeth him to ſpeake vpon truſt, and that he buſieth himſelfe with quirkes and ſubtleties, and ſayes that he makes S. <hi>Paul</hi> an Interpreter of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalips.</p>
                  <p>This is the forme of his writing: as for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſubſtance of his booke, I finde, that he hath ill meaſured his owne ſtrength, and that with the weakeneſſe and meaneneſſe of his skill, he hath made the ſtrength of his Maieſties reaſons more manifeſt. Gyants are not to be ouerthrown with a breath, neyther is a Lion to be fought againſt with a <hi>Feſtue.</hi> Other kind of forces are neceſſary to make reſiſtance to ſo exquiſite a doctrine, that is euer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſuſtained by the truth. And indeede he clearely confeſſeth his weakeneſſe in this, that hee neuer cyteth the Text of the Kings booke, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reporteth the ſenſe thereof diſguiſed and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that he may giue himſelfe greater ſcope and liberty, forming to himſelf <hi>Chimera's,</hi> which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth with other <hi>Chimera's</hi> of his owne, as will

                  </p>
                  <p>To this I ſay, <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> hath beene very ill enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, for the conſpiracies againſt the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands life, haue not with-held or kept him from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery; ſince euen from his Infancy he hath made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen profeſsion of the true Religion, and before
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:11466:16"/>this conſpiracy had publiſhed the confeſſion of his faith conformable to that which we profeſſe.</p>
                  <p>And whereas he condemnes ſuch attempts, as are made vpon the liues of Kings, we greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him for it; and thereby ſuppoſe that he no way approued the enterprize of <hi>Iames Clement,</hi> who was domeſticke with him and his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: From thence I likewiſe gather, that when the Ieſuite <hi>Mariana</hi> in the ſixt Chapter of his booke <hi>De Regno,</hi> prayſeth the Act of <hi>Iames Clement,</hi> ſaying that he was perſwaded, and enduced thereunto by Diuines, with whom hee had conferr'd: I gather that <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> was none of thoſe Diuines, and that when this Parricide Saint, and <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> went a begging together, hee made him not acquainted with his ſecret. And further it is no ſmall vertue in this Doctor, that he feareth not in ſo iuſt a cauſe to condemne many Ieſuites, who were complices or inſtigators of this laſt conſpiracy, and haue been executed for it. Nay more, it ſheweth a magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in <hi>Coeffeteau,</hi> that hee dares ſo couragiouſly oppoſe himſelfe to the Pope and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who (by their letters before mentioned) incite the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh to rebellion, which could neuer take effect ſo long as the Kings life ſhould be in ſafety. By the ſame meanes he likewiſe condemneth the Authors of the Legend of S. <hi>Iames Clement,</hi> which wee haue ſeene with our eyes, but not without much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and admiration. The ſucceſſe of things haue grudged him this honor; and men haue beene no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing fauourable and propitious to this Saint, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:11466:16"/>doubtleſſe hee had before this beene put into paradice. It is likewiſe a cauſe of iuſt ioy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, to ſee that a Doctor of the <hi>Sorbons</hi> dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the ſentence of the Court of Parliament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Iohn Chaſtell,</hi> though the Pope of late hath newly cenſured it; By which it dooth alſo follow that he doth not thinke it well done, that <hi>Garnet</hi> and <hi>Ouldcorne</hi> Ieſuites, and parties in the gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der treaſon, are at Rome inſerted in a roll of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres. Whoſoeuer prayſeth and approueth an acte already done, will queſtionleſſe counſel and aduiſe the doing of it; for that which is wicked in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, cannot be good in the execution: But the Pope in his breue before mentioned, calleth the puniſhment of Treaſon and rebellion by the name of <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> which is a dangerous ſpeech, &amp; able to make Kings tremble, when the people ſhall be taught by Murders and Treaſons to ſeeke the Crowne of Martyrdome, An abhominable and deteſtable doctrine: can there be any ſo colde and frozen zeale, that will not hereby be warmed, and moued to a iuſt anger, that this ſo ſacred name of <hi>Martyr,</hi> ſo much reuerenced in the Church, ſhould in ſuch ſort be proſtituted, that whereas the holy Scripture calleth them <hi>Martyrs,</hi> which ſuffer for the teſtimony of the Goſpell; now a dayes thoſe which haue their handes ſtayned and ſoyled with the blood of <hi>Kings</hi> ſhould be honoured with that Title? It is not the ſuffering but the cauſe that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a Martyr; otherwiſe the diuell might likewiſe haue his Martyrs, but ſuch paines are crymes, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:11466:17"/>are not onely vnworthy of praiſe, but are likewiſe vnworthy of pardon, and ſuch pains and torments, as are againe to be puniſhed with future torments. Is it then fit that the holy ſquadron of Martyrs, where S. <hi>Stephen</hi> marcheth firſt, and S. <hi>Iames</hi> neare vnto him, and after them the reſt of the Apoſtles; followed by ſo many of the faithfull, who haue bin prodigall of their bloods, but careful and thriftie of the glory of God: Is it fit amongſt them to finde Incendiaries and Parricides with fire and ſword in hand; not like vnto S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> that is to ſay, not repreſenting their puniſhments, but as teſtimonies of their crymes, not to ſignifie the death by which they died, but to declare the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how they murdered? Vnhappy age, that ſtyleth villaines with title of vertue: and that by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting of words and names, depraueth the things themſelues, and ſo by a new kinde of Grammer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducteth a new kinde of Diuinity. But God be praiſed, that he hath not permitted the Pope by his skill and arte, to plant this perſwaſion generally in the hearts of the people, but that euen amongſt our aduerſaries themſelues, there are very many that no way approue this ſeditious and bloody do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: Amongſt which number I would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place the Doctor <hi>Coeffeteau,</hi> becauſe of his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations, were it not that he allayes them with ſuch modifications and reſtrictions, as giues vs cauſe to doubt of them: And which teſtifie that thoſe Kings, with whoſe liues and Crownes he would not haue medled, are onely ſuch Kings as are obedient to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:11466:17"/>the Biſhop of Rome, for he ſaith, <hi>That the Church of Rome wiſheth to Princes an aſſured Empire, victorious Armes, and an obedient people.</hi> Now it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that the Pope deſireth not, that thoſe Kings which condemne him ſhould bee victorious, or that their people ſhould remain in their obedience, ſince he depoſeth them from their Thrones, and diſpenſeth to their ſubiects the Oath of their Allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. And a little while after he ſaith, that hee ſpeaketh of ſuch eſtates, wherein the Church (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Church of Rome) ſubſiſteth, which is as much to ſay, that where it cannot ſubſiſt, there hee approueth this rebellion and murther, which he more clearely ſheweth after <hi>Fol. 6. pag.</hi> 1. where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe wordes: <hi>That the Pope cannot diſapproue the courſes that you hold to ſecure your Authority and perſon:</hi> he addeth, <hi>So that they be not offenſiue to that Religion which he is bound to defend.</hi> So that hereof it followeth, that if the Romane Religion doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any offence in England: Then the Pope doth no longer approue the courſes, that the King hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for his conſeruation. But he giueth after more certaine proofes of his intention, the which wee will remarke in their due places. Beſides we doubt not, but a prudent perſon knoweth how to faſhion himſelfe to the times, and to reſerue his bloody propoſitions for fitter occaſions. And many times enterprizes are onely blamed becauſe they are not ſuccesfull, and vices are turned to vertue by hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py euents. <hi>Multa ſunt, quae non niſi peracta Laundan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> And the iudgements of thoſe, whoſe malice
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:11466:18"/>is accompanied with doubt and feare, are framed according to the ſucceſſe. But in reſpect of our friendſhip, I am rather enclined to thinke well of him, and to free him of this ſuſpition.</p>
                  <p>I will therefore conclude this Chapter with an obſeruation, which I thinke not fit to be omitted; and it is, that in the time of S. <hi>Paul Nero</hi> was then Emperour, which Monſter God eyther for the ſcorne of men, or for their puniſhment had placed in the Empire; who by his example declared to what height, abſolute and exquiſite wickedneſſe, aſſiſted with Soueraigne power could aſcend; who likewiſe was the firſt that ſtirred vp perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt the Chriſtians. Had the Chriſtians e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer greater cauſe to rebell? Or ſerued they euer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a more vnworthy Maſter? Now I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of my Maſters the Papiſts, if S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould haue made a Myne vnder his houſe, or vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of ſalutations ſhould haue ſtrucken him to the heart with a Poniard, or had beene taken in any of theſe enterprizes, and ſo put to death for them; whether had he beene a <hi>Martyr,</hi> or whether had his death beene acceptable, or tended to the edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church? But becauſe this is a queſtion full of difficulties, it is fit we ſhould leaue it vndeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and that we expect ſome reſolution from the Doctors, or ſome deciſion from his Holineſſe.</p>
                  <p>After this <hi>Coeffeteau Fol. 6.</hi> ſpeaketh by the way, of the Popes power ouer the temporality of Kings, and promiſeth afterwards to ſpeake more at large. Wee therefore to auoyde the repetition of things
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:11466:18"/>twice, will ſet aſide that ſubiect till he commeth to the place where hee fully handleth it. And now let vs heare what he ſaith of the dignity of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, <hi>Fol.</hi> 8.</p>

                        <hi>Fol.</hi> 8.</note> beſeeching him to remember that <hi>Caluine</hi> acknowledged that the Cardinals flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:11466:19"/>in the time of S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> which is one thouſand yeares ſince; and that euen in the Councell of Rome, vnder <hi>Silueſter</hi> the firſt, there is mention made of the ſeuen Deacon Cardinals, as of no new Inſtitution then: And addeth, that their charge was to inſtruct the people, and to miniſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. And ſince, they hauing gotten vnto themſelues the election of the <hi>Pope;</hi> and being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes neere about him, their glory is growne and increaſed, by which the Church hath receiued much eaſe and furtherance: the head of the Church hauing alwayes about his perſon, his Councell in affaires of greateſt importance. Hee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſaith, that Kings reuerence them; but they are ſo farre from making themſelues equall with Kings, that Princes finde none that beare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with more reſpect towards them, then theſe great ones doe. And ſo he endeth his amplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the praiſe of the Cardinal of <hi>Perron.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to begin with theſe which he oppoſeth vnto vs:<note place="margin">The anſwers.</note> I doe acknowledge, that theſe two Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, carried along with the current of the time and courſe of affaires, haue by their wils and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties much helped the defence of errour, they haue imployed their veſſels of golde and ſiluer, which they brought out of Egypt, to the making of the golden Calfe: and <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> hath little in his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings that he hath not filtched from them. But I know that they diſagree in many things, and that the Cardinall of <hi>Perron</hi> loueth his King too well to aſſent with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that the Pope may either
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:11466:19"/>directly or indirectly depriue him of his Crowne, or diſpence to French-men the obedience they owe him.</p>
                  <p>As for the thing it ſelfe, that is, the antiquity, charge and modeſty of Cardinals, it requireth a longer diſcourſe. Men diſpute of the originall of Cardinals, as they doe of the head and ſourſe of the riuer <hi>Nilus.</hi> The greateſt antiquity that <hi>Coef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feteau</hi> is able to produce, is the teſtimony of the Romane Councell, held (if we may giue credite to the impreſſion) vnder <hi>Silueſter</hi> the firſt ſince the Counſell of <hi>Nice.</hi> But it is eaſie for vs to conuince this of falſhood, being forged by ſome ſhallow braine that wanted learning to lie with skill and dexterity.<note place="margin">The Cullen Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. p. <hi>357.</hi>
                     </note> This Counſell is found in the firſt <hi>Tome</hi> of the Counſels reduced into twenty Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whereof the firſt ſaith, that in this Counſell there were 139. Biſhoppes, aſwell of the City of Rome, as of other places neare about it, which is well knowne to be impoſſible: In the laſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Silueſter</hi> prohibiteth the Emperour and Kings to be Iudges of the Biſhop of Rome. Now it is ſtrange how this ſhould be, ſince at that time, there were no Kings in all Chriſtendome; there he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſaith that <hi>Constantine,</hi> and his mother <hi>Helena,</hi> ſubſcribed to this Counſel, but <hi>Constantine</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer at Rome vnder <hi>Siluester,</hi> ſince the Counſell of <hi>Nice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and women neuer ſubſcribed to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels at all. He further addeth, <hi>Actum in Traianas thermas,</hi> as though this Counſell had beene faine to hide it ſelfe in the Stoaues: In the ſame place
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:11466:20"/>
                     <hi>Conſtantine</hi> is called <hi>Donnus Conſtantinus</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Dominus;</hi> but in thoſe times the Latine tongue was not become ſo ſtrangely corrupted, beſides, amongſt the Romanes this very word <hi>Dominus</hi> was then odious, as attributed to tyrants. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſaith, that this Counſell was held <hi>Conſtantino Auguſto tertio</hi> (hee meant to haue ſaid) <hi>tertiùm, &amp; Priſco conſulibus:</hi> which is a moſt apparant vntruth; for we finde in the Chronicles of <hi>Caſsiodorus,</hi> and in the <hi>Faſti</hi> of <hi>Onuphrius</hi> and <hi>Annian Marcellinus</hi> all the Conſulſhips of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> but it cannot be found that eyther <hi>Priſcus</hi> or any of the family of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> were companions with <hi>Conſtantine</hi> in Conſulſhippe; and further, in the page before this Counſell, <hi>Siluester</hi> writeth to the Counſell of <hi>Nice,</hi> and deteth his letters from the ſeuenth time of <hi>Conſtantines</hi> being Conſull. And yet ſee this goodly Counſell which was held ſince, and yet beareth date from his third Conſulſhippe. It is likewiſe to be proued that both <hi>Silueſter</hi> and <hi>Hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> were long afore this deceaſed.</p>
                  <p>Theſe vntruths are very eaſie to be diſcerned, and any ordinary iudgement will diſcouer them, but to <hi>Coeffeteau,</hi> who hath no great skill in any good learning, any proofes will ſerue his turne; It had beene very fitting, that ſo royall a worke might haue had a learned aduerſary, was there not in Fraunce ſome more able and ſufficient man, that might haue ſeduced with a better grace? or could haue found better pretences and colours to haue oppoſed the truth? Certainly it is much to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:11466:20"/>grace of our nation. But theſe are briefly his proofes of the antiquity of Cardinals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cóeffeteau</hi> doth further add, that <hi>Caluine</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that Cardinals did flouriſh in the time of <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt,<note place="margin">In the fourth booke of his Inſtitution. Chap. 7. §. 30.</note> which was ſixe hundred yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt: and this is likewiſe another vntruth; <hi>Caluine</hi> ſaith indeede that there was then the Title and name of Cardinal, but not the charge, and that in that age this word CARDINALL, ſignified nothing leſſe then what it doth now a dayes, and the ſubſtance being chaunged, the word hath ſtill continued; euen as we ſee in the Apothecaries box, though the oyntment be gone the inſcripion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth: Alſo <hi>Caluine</hi> ſpeaketh not of their flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing but of their being: <hi>Gregory</hi> indeed in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leauenth Epiſtle of his fift booke, ſpeaketh of a Cardinall Deacon: And likewiſe in the foure and twentieth Epiſtle of his eleuenth booke, he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of a Cardinall Prieſt, which is as much to ſay as principall: in the ſame ſenſe and nature as we ſay the Cardinall windes, or Cardinall vertues, which ſignifie onely the cheefe and principall. But of any Cardinall Biſhops, neyther he nor any of his time, nor long after made any kinde of mention. A Cardinall Prieſt then had no other ſignification, then the Parſon or Vicar of a Pariſh hath now; neyther was this title onely vſed in Rome,<note place="margin">There conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſtill Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals at Compoſtella.</note> but in all other great Archiepiſcopall Citties, as namely in <hi>Millane,</hi> where <hi>Sigonius</hi> towards the end of his ſeuenth booke, ſaith, that there were then two and twenty Cardinals: but there being then in one
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:11466:21"/>Pariſh diuers Prieſts, he that was the firſt and chiefe was called principall or Cardinall, for they ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both one thing; as<note n="*" place="margin">Pandulphi de vitis Pontificum in Electione Gelaſij. ij.</note>

                     <hi>Onuphrius</hi> teacheth vs. For <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his firſt booke <hi>de Clericis Chap.</hi> 16 is miſtaken, where he ſaith, that in the fourth booke of <hi>Gregories</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <hi>Chap.</hi> 88. there are ſubſcriptions of diuers Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall Prieſts, bearing the ſame title, which is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vntrue; for there is no mention made of Cardinals, and by Prieſts of the ſame title is meant ſimply in that place, Prieſts of the ſame Church or Pariſh: He likewiſe there alleadgeth the Counſell of Rome falſe and counterfeited. And hee alſo ſpeaketh of Cardinall Biſhops, which were neyther in the time of <hi>Gregory,</hi> nor long after: ſo that in few lines he committeth three groſſe errours: This then ſtandeth thus; that the Cardinall Prieſts were no more but the principall Prieſts of euery Pariſh: and of this there remayneth to this day ſome ſhewes and traces, for that euery Cardinall Biſhop or Prieſt, beareth the title of ſome Church or Pariſh of the citie of Rome, which doth more plainly appeare by the forme of the reception of new Cardinals, as it is ſet down in the firſt book of the holy ceremonies. Section the 8. chap. 12. where the Pope after he hath put a ringe on the finger of the new Cardinall that kneeleth before him, ſayeth vnto him, <hi>To the honour of God, and of the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Peter and Paul, and of ſuch or ſuch a Saint; wee commit vnto you the Church of S. Sabina, or of S. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſogonus, &amp;c.</hi> that is, he committeth to him one of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:11466:21"/>the Pariſhes of Rome, which is nothing but a bare formality, and wordes without ſubſtance; for after this ceremony, this new Cardinall returneth home (it may be) into Fraunce or Sapine, without euer ſetting his foote againe into the Church, of which he beares the title: And from thence it grew, that for a long time, there was in Rome but eight and twenty Cardinall Prieſts, according to the number of the auncient Pariſhes in Rome, which was ſeuen Churches vnder euery one of the foure principall and Patriarchall Churches of Rome: as for the fift, that is the Church of <hi>Lateran,</hi> where the Pope made his reſidence, that was aboue the other foure.</p>
                  <p>This number of eight and twenty Cardinall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes (that is to ſay) Parſons of Pariſhes continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Rome, vntill the time of <hi>Honorius</hi> the ſecond, father of the <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> in the yeare 1125. as <hi>Onu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrius</hi> ſheweth; ſince which time, the number hath encreaſed or leſſened, according to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Popes, who were at that time in the height of their glory; And the dignity of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes of <hi>Millaine</hi> and <hi>Rauenna</hi> being decayed, (which before were held equall with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi>) Since that there hath beene little ſpeech, but onely of the Cardinals of <hi>Rome.</hi> As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Deacons, the cuſtome of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was to haue onely ſeuen; following the example of the ſixt Chapter of the Actes of the Apoſtles, whoſe charge was to keepe and diſtribute the almes, and to carry the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> in the Church to

                  <p>By what which is already faid, it appeareth that the Cardinals now a dayes haue no more reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of thoſe of former times, then the Pope hath of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> or the Maſſe of the Lords ſupper: firſt, the auncient Cardinals were Paſtors or Deacons of the Pariſhes of Rome, to teach and to adminiſter the Sacraments; but the Cardinals now neyther teach nor haue any cure of ſoules: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, then the Cardinalſhip was a function, now it is a dignitie:<note place="margin">Moſt ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals is in vſe one of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber weekes.</note> thirdly, then a Cardinall was not made but vpon the death of ſome other, becauſe that the Pariſh might not remaine without a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor. But now the Pope createth when he pleaſeth, and as many as he pleaſeth; by which it hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that the Pope being careleſſe thereof, the number hath beene ſo ſtrangely diminiſhed, that when <hi>Vrban</hi> the fourth was elected, there were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two Cardinals;<note place="margin">Onuphrius.</note> ſo contrary to this, <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth created eight and thirty in one day: fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Then the Romane Cardinals were onely in the City of Rome, whereas now they are euery where elſe, and rule the Counſels of diuers Kings. It is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:11466:23"/>likewiſe to be preſumed, that in auncient time ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was made of Cardinall Prieſts of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſuch as were of moſt ſufficiency; but now the Cardinalſhippe is beſtowed vpon Infants, and Princes children that are altogether vnlearned, as likewiſe vpon others, at the requeſt and intreaty of Kings, in recompence of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices. Then the title of Cardinall Prieſts did not lift him vp higher then his fellowes, but onely in ſome kinde of precedency in order, as <hi>Onuphrius</hi> ſaith: <hi>Nihil dignitatis aut praeeminentiae illis dabat antiquitus eſſe Cardinales.</hi> But now the Cardinals looke downe from a greater height vpon the reſt of the Clergy, who are very many degrees beneath their greatneſſe. There was in thoſe times no ſpeech of Cardinall Biſhops; and if any Cardinall Prieſt of one of the Pariſhes of <hi>Rome</hi> became a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of any City of Italy, he reteyned no longer the name of Cardinall, no more then a Parſon that is made Biſhop now, reteyneth the name of Parſon ſtill; but it were now to goe backewards, and to ſtoope very low, for a Cardinall to become a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and leaue his Cardinalſhip.

                  <p>The which will be more apparant, when I ſhall haue examined the truth of that which <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> ſayth, affirming that Cardinals are moſt reſpectfull to Princes, and that they deſire not to goe vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen termes with them: I ſpeake not to touch any that are liuing; but as it may well be, that a man may diſlike of his Cloake becauſe it is too gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſo it is likewiſe poſſible that many of thoſe which haue beene aduanced to this degree, doe thinke that there is too great pompe and glittering in this habite: we will therfore ſpeake onely of the rules and general cuſtomes of the Roman Church, which queſtionleſſe doe equall Cardinals with Kings; for marke the titles which Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond giueth them in the ſixt Chapter of the eight Section of the firſt booke of the holy Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies:<note n="*" place="margin">Ad collegium Apoſtolicum vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cati conſiliarij noſtri &amp; coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices orbis terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, Succeſſores Apoſtlorum cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca thronum ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debitis, vos Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natores vrbis &amp; regum ſimiles, &amp;c.</note>

Then England enioyed the happy golden age, in which euery man for his money might enter into Paradiſe: but Ieſus
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:11466:33"/>Chriſt ouerthrew this bancke of money-changers ſet vp in the Temple, and detecting the abuſes, ſheered aſunder thoſe inuiſible chains of Cuſtome and Opinion, which held mens ſoules enſnared in and vniuſt ſeruitude. Certainely then the doctrine of the Goſpell is the ſetling and eſtabliſhment of Thrones, and that which exalteth &amp; raiſeth Kings, ſeeing that it doth: not ſubiect their Crownes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man liuing, and further ſtoppeth vp all wayes and acceſſe to rebellion and diſloyaltie.</p>
                  <p>Now out of that which aboue hath beene ſaid, it is euident that <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> (telling the king of great Britaine that the Pope doth neyther expoſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes as a prey, nor pretend any thing vpon the temporalties of kings) thought the king a ſtranger at his owne home, and one that knew not his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogie nor the ſtory of his owne houſe; or elſe deemed him blinde, and bereft of ſenſe, when hee complayneth in his Apologie, that <hi>Bellarm.</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt him, dooth importunately inculcate this poſition, that the Pope may depoſe kings, in that he may excommunicate them. It muſt needes be then (if we beleeue <hi>Coeffeteau</hi>) that the king of great Britainecy ther did not read, or elſe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not the booke of his Aduerſary.</p>

And he goeth about to teach them more modeſty in ſpeach, then they are willing to learne, vnleſſe that perhaps to tumble downe a Prince from the height of his Empire with flaſhes of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or to skimme away the whole wealth of his Countrey, be not to be termed a touching of their temporalties: And indeede there is ſome reaſon for that, for temporall goods when they come into his Holineſſe handes, they become ſpirituall, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſtile which this witty age vſeth, who by a Biſhops ſpiritualties vnderſtandeth the rents and reuenues of his Biſhoppricke. The miſery of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in this caſe is, that if the Pope for their ſinnes impoſe this penance vpon them, to lay down their Crownes, and to giue place to another, yet this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance once done, is neuer followed with Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:

There be ſteppes and degrees indeede to clymbe vp to a kingdome, but there is no other diſcent then a headlong downe-fall.

And to ſhew that hee ought to proceede forcibly, and by way of fact, <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> addeth, <hi>That the Pope ought to oppoſe himſelfe herein euen to the perill of his life:</hi> And if we will exactly weigh the wordes of this Doctrine, <hi>fol.</hi> 7. we ſhall eaſily finde, that where he ſaith that the Pope doth not pretend any thing ouer the temporalties of Princes, hee meaneth all the while Romiſh Catholicke Princes, who obey the Pope, that is to ſay, that if they bee not ſuch as are now a dayes called Catholicks, the Pope may depriue them of their Kingdomes.</p>

                  <p>By all theſe Scientificall Demonſtrations, hee proueth that the Pope is cheefe ouer the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raltie as well as ouer the Spiritualty; and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon admiring himſelfe in his own plumes, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth by a new Article of faith: <hi>We declare, affirm, define and pronounce, that it is altogether neceſſary to ſaluation to be ſubiect to the Biſhop of Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I would refute each of theſe reaſons, were it not that I am perſwaded, that the Pope did but mocke when he thus ſpake, and had no meaning to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued. For ſurely <hi>Shamgars</hi> goade, or <hi>Gedeons</hi> bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels may as well prooue the Popes Empire ouer Kings as any of the former places. And indeede <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who commendeth this Bull in generall as holy and good, hath beene aſhamed to produce theſe goodly reaſons in ſpeciall and by retaile, it is confutation enough for them onely to haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them. For to diſpute by Scripture againſt them, were to vnſheath the ſword of the Goſpell againſt a filthy dung-hil. Such reaſons be fit to be propoſed but with the ſword in hand; for they are not receiued farther then he that propoſeth them is feared. And to very good purpoſe the King doth
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:11466:37"/>here apply the Fable, that when the Lyon would haue the Aſſes eares to be hornes, the other beaſts were bound to beleeue it. So theſe fooleries muſt paſſe for verities, becauſe his Holineſſe will haue it ſo.</p>
                  <p>Such a like May-game do we find in <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and in all their late Diuines, who willing to cloake this their foule fact, haue inuented new termes to expreſſe the ſame thing. <hi>They ſay that the Pope, as Pope, hath not this power ouer the Temporalty directly but indirectly, and ſo farre forth as it is auaileable for the ſpirituall good.</hi> But a King diſpoyled of his Throne cannot take a few diſtinctions for a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent payment; for what is it to him whether he be depoſed directly or indirectly, ſeeing that he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his Kingdome, be it in what ſort ſoeuer: it is as if a man ſhould comfort one vpon the ſcaffold, going to his execution, telling him, thou ſhalt not be beheaded with a ſword, but with a Fauchin. And indeed who doth not ſee that this diſtinction is but a meere contradiction? For that which is in it ſelfe euill, being done by a direct courſe, cannot be done iuſtly by an indirect courſe. If a ſubiect be forbidden to wrong his Prince directly, ſhall it be lawfull for him to hurt him indirectly? Surely that which I ought not to take away directly, I may not filtch away indirectly and by wrongfull dealing, ſeeing that the thing can no wayes belong to mee in what ſort ſoeuer. Furthermore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> by this diſtinction hath no meaning to contradict the Popes, whom we haue produced, who ſpeake of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:11466:38"/>Kings as of their ſubiects, and terme themſelues Soueraignes in temporall affaires, ſo that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth all to one.</p>
                  <p>It bootes not to diſpute of the excellency of the ſpirituall power aboue the Ciuil, by comparing (as did <hi>Innocent</hi> the third) the Pope to the Sunne, and the Emperour to the Moone; for albeit this were ſo, yet doth not the excellency of one thing aboue another neceſſarily import that one muſt therefore gouerne another: for if I ſay that the faculty of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity is more noble and more excellent, then the care and cuſtody of the Kings Treaſure, muſt it needes therefore follow that Diuines and Clergy men muſt ſway the Kings Exchequer? And as litle to the purpoſe is it to alleadge that the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power is ſubiect to the ſpirituall; for the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not whether it be ſimply ſubiect vnto it, but whether it be ſubiect to it in temporall things, and with what puniſhments the Paſtor of the Church may puniſh the Magiſtrate when he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth his duety,<note place="margin">Foüiller en ſa bourſe.</note> to wit, whether by depriuing him of his eſtates or by fingering his purſe; this is the point of the queſtion which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was to proue and not to ſuppoſe. For what authority ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer God hath giuen to faithfull Paſtors ouer the Magiſtrates as they are Chriſtians, yet doe they not let for all that to be ſubiect to the Magiſtrates as they are Citizens, and make a part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. A king that is ſicke, is for the time ſubiect to the gouernement of his Phyſitians, and yet they neuertheles remaine his ſubiects. As then
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:11466:38"/>the Temporall gouernement doth not impoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall puniſhments, ſo the ſpirituall gouernement cannot impoſe temporall puniſhments, vnleſſe it be ſometimes by miracle, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> did vpon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira;</hi> for ordinary power he hath none to doe it, neyther doth the word of God giue him any.</p>
                  <p>Now if the Pope by vertue of his keyes (of which he ſo much boaſteth) could diſpoſſeſſe a King of his Kingdome for any fault, whether it be true or pretended, it ſhould thence follow, that he hath a greater power ouer Kings then oner priuate and particular men, from whom he cannot by way of Penance plucke away their lands or houſes to giue them to their neighbours: for if it were ſo, the Pope ſhould be the direct Lord of all the lands and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of Chriſtendome. And ſeeing it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally confeſſed, that the Heathen Emperours were not ſubiect to the Biſhops in temporall matters; can it ſtand with reaſon that Princes by being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſtians, ſhould become leſſe Soueraignes then they were before, and that the faith of Ieſus Chriſt ſhould diminiſh their Empire?</p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant that the Prince ought ſo to adminiſter temporall things, that the ſpirituall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration be not thereby impeached I know alſo that if Princes offend God, it belongeth to the Paſtors not to be ſilent, but to oppoſe themſelues againſt that euil, by al thoſe wayes &amp; means which God hath permitted, which are courſes ful of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and farre from any rebellion and ſedition.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:11466:39"/>The faithfull Paſtor that ſhall leaſt of all flatter the Magiſtrate in his vices, is the man that ſhall care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully retaine the people in their obedience towards the Magiſtrate, and ſhall keepe that golden meane which is betweene flattery and ſedition. As he muſt not be a dumbe dogge, ſo muſt he not be a furious beaſt that had neede to be tyed vp.</p>
                  <p>And to the end that you may know, that theſe two kindes of ſubiection doe not iuſtle or ſhoulder each other as incompatible; I ſay that the Princes and the Paſtors in a State, are as the will and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in the ſoule of a man. The will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth the vnderſtanding with an abſolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, which the Greekes call <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or Lord-like, inioyning it to ſtudy or to learne this or that thing. But the vnderſtanding on the other ſide leadeth on the will by ſuggeſtion without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund; the one is done by authority the other by perſwaſion. So Princes command Paſtors, Paſtors ſollicite and intreate Princes: The reſpect which Princes owe vnto them is not to their perſons, but to their charge and calling, and to the word or meſſage which they bring, for they be not the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle it ſelfe, but onely the Candleſticke on which it is ſet,<note place="margin">

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:11466:39"/>Againe the vnderſtanding is to guide the will in al things, but the Prince in an infinite of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe may do well enough without the helpe and counſell of his Clergy, eſpecially in affaires that are temporall and meerely ciuill. Againe the will doth neuer teach the vnderſtanding; for it conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wholly in motion and action; but many Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces haue reformed their Paſtors, and brought them back to their dueties; as did <hi>Conſtantine</hi> who in the Councell of Nice ſtifeled and ſmothered vp all quarrels among the Biſhops by caſting their diffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matorie libels into the fire: as did <hi>Dauid,</hi> who ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted new orders in the Temple: and as did <hi>Salomon</hi> who depoſed <hi>Abiathar</hi> from the Prieſthood, being attainted of conſpiracy againſt him. And likewiſe <hi>Ezechias</hi> and <hi>Ichoſaphat,</hi> who clenſed the Temple and ſet vp the purity of Gods ſeruice againe. In this ſenſe, a Synodall Epiſtle written to <hi>Lewes</hi> the Courteous, calleth him <hi>Rectorem Eccleſiae,</hi> gouernor of the Church. And <hi>Lewes</hi> his young ſonne being at Pauia, tooke an account of the liues of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and of their diligence in their charge, as <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonius</hi> witneſſeth in the yeare 855. The ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour ſaith in his ſeuenth booke that <hi>Adrian</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vpon <hi>Charlemaigne</hi> the honour of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church, and of chooſing the Biſhoppe of Rome; not that he might change the doctrine of the Church at his pleaſure, but only to hold a ſtrait hand for the execution of the things which were enioyned by the word of God.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> addeth for a ſecond reaſon, <hi>That
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:11466:40"/>if the Church</hi> (that is to ſay the Pope) <hi>had not the power to diſpoſe of temporall things it could neuer at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to perfection, but ſhould want neceſſary power to arriue at her intended end: For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>wicked Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might without feare of puniſhment intertaine here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes to the ouerthrow of Religion.</hi> This is a reaſon without reaſon, and full of impiety, for it accuſeth the Church which was in the Apoſtles times of imperfection; which then had no power at all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Temporalty, all things being then in the handes of Infidels. Add hereunto, that Kings might vſe the ſame reaſon, and ſay, that their power could not be perfect vnleſſe they had the meanes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of ſpirituall things, for that otherwiſe wicked Biſhops might without feare of puniſhment be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, mutinous, Necromancers and firebrands of ſedition againſt Princes: of all which enormities the Sea of the Biſhop of Rome can alone furniſh a multitude of examples; yea, after <hi>Baronius, Coeffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau</hi> himſelfe doth confeſſe,<note place="margin">

No otherwiſe then the perfection of Philoſophy dooth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in hauing a ſtrong houſe, or a good ſword able to repreſſe thoſe that ſhould hinder her from being taught and profeſſed; but rather in the certainty, perſpicuity and ſufficiency of her Demonſtrations. God who hath neuer ſuffered that his Church ſhould be extinguiſhed by falſe teachers which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:11466:40"/>the ſoules, will not permit that it ſhall be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by wicked Princes which offer violence to the bodies; for whatſoeuer neceſſity any man can alleadge why he ſhould plucke the Crowne from a lawfull Princes head, yet can there be no neceſſity of doing any thing contrary to the will of God; as there is no neceſſity that doth binde a man to bee diſloyall, there can be no diſpenſing with the law of God. God ſayth by the mouth of his Apoſtle,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1.</note> 
                     <hi>That euery perſon ought to be ſubiect to ſuperior powers for there is no power but of God:</hi> Where it is cleare that he ſpeaketh of Princes and temporall Lords, becauſe he addeth, that they beare the ſword, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Miniſters of God, ordeyned for iuſtice: And a little after he commaundeth to pay them tribute and cuſtomes. Now at the time when the Apoſtle ſpake this, neyther the Biſhoppe of Rome nor any other did eyther carry the ſword or receiue any tribute. Who is he then that can diſpenſe with ſo preciſe a commaundement? Or what thing can be more neceſſary then to obey God? And note moreouer, that if the Pope be the Iudge of this caſe of neceſſity, for which Princes ought to be diſpoſſeſt, it will bee eaſie for him at any time to ſay, that it is neceſſary that this or that King be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded, to the end to make himſelfe by that means King of Kings and diſpoſer of their Crownes.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit let vs a little weigh and conſider what this neceſſity may be, which carrieth on the Pope to plucke from a King his Scepter, and to giue his Crowne to another. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alleadgeth but

As in caſe a King be an Hereticke, an Infidell, or a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor of the Church, or a fauourer and vpholder of errour. But he would faine hide and conceale from vs that the Pope doth aſwell intrude himſelfe to diſpoſſeſſe Kings that are of his Religion, and no way in fault.

                  <p>I freely indeede confeſſe, that in an Electiue kingdome, when queſtion is made of chooſing a new king, they to whom that charge belongeth, ought in no wiſe to chuſe a king that is an Infidell or an Idolater. But it is one thing to ſpeake of a king who is choſen by his ſubiects; and another, of a king who is a lawfull inheritour, and who is beholding to his birth for his Crowne, and to whom, ouer and aboue, his ſubiects haue taken the Oath of Alleageance. And therefore the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> draweth from the one
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:11466:41"/>to the other, to proue that Subiects are at no hand to endure a king that is an Heretick or an Infidel, doth not follow vpon good conſequence. It a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayleth not to ſay that the danger is like both in the one and the other; for it may ſo fall out that two things may be alike dangerous, whereof the one may be bad, and the other not: as for example, for a man to receiue in his body the ſhot of an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſe from one that did aime to hit him, &amp; from another that did it by chance is alike dangerous, but not alike wicked. And indeede euen in humane pollicy, and without any relation to the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God, it is not expedient that ſubiects ſhould ſhake off the yoake of their Prince which is of a different Religion: for this were the next way to eſtrange Princes and Monarches from Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, and to make them to haue it in deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that which counſelleth and perſwadeth to rebellion, and maketh piety the cauſe of mutiny. Moreouer the queſtion here is not of the danger, but of the duety, nor yet what may arriue, but what ought to be done; we muſt not do euill that good may come of it. Many things are lawfull which are not expedient, but there is nothing expedient which is not lawfull When we haue done what we ought to doe, then God will doe what pleaſeth him; and he will doe nothing but for the good of his Church, which he cheriſheth as the apple of his eye: he hath bought it too deare, that he ſhould be of the minde to deſtroy it. Now if this rule of the Cardinall be neceſſary: that it is not permitted
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:11466:42"/>to Chriſtians to ſuffer a King that is an Hereticke or an Infidell: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was very much miſtaken in giuing commaundement to obey <hi>Nero</hi> an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell and a perſecutor, and the Chriſtians then did not as they ought to haue done, in that they did not ſtabbe him, or make a myne of powder vnder his houſe: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwereth, that they might iuſtly haue done it, but that they wanted forces, that is to ſay,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>5.</hi> de Rom.

O bleſſed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, how fitly to the purpoſe doſt thou ſtop this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaſion, &amp; furniſheſt vs with an anſwer that cutteth off all difficultie? for he ſaith, <hi>That we muſt be ſubiect to Princes not only for wrath, but euen for conſcience ſake.</hi> He wil that we obey Princes, not only for feare of incurring thier diſpleaſure, but alſo to ſatisfie the conſcience and our duety towards God. And S. <hi>Peter</hi> in like manner, in his firſt Epiſtle and ſecond Chapter, <hi>Submit your ſelues to all manner ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, whether it be to the King as to the Superiour, &amp;c.</hi> This then is to be done, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſtoope and yeelde to the preſent neceſſity, but alſo for Gods ſake.

                  <p>But what wil they ſay if we produce ages, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Orthodox Chriſtians were the ſtronger party, and yet did they abſtaine from the life or Crowne of the Emperour. <hi>Constantius</hi> was an Arrian, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom <hi>Liberius</hi> Biſhoppe of Rome did not caſt forth his lightnings, neyther did hee attempt to diſpoſſeſſe him, but vpon the Emperours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund hee went into baniſhment. After his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſtata mightily laboured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore Paganiſme, at what time almoſt the whole Empire was Chriſtian; and that which is more, his Armies were compoſed of Chriſtian ſouldiers, as <hi>Ruffinus</hi> witneſſeth in the firſt booke of his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Theodoret, lib</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Socrates, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 19.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:11466:43"/>So then Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth accuſe the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Biſhops of Rome, for that during the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Church, they vſed not thoſe means and remedies which they had in their hands, in that they drew onely the ſpirituall ſword, whereas our new Popes skirmiſh with both hands, and flouriſh both ſwords, beſides all other dexterities.</p>
                  <p>Yea futher if the auncient Biſhoppes of Rome were in doubt to prouoke the Emperors, for feare of being cauſe of much ſlaughter and confuſion; why did not this feare with-hold the late Popes from thundring againſt the Emperours <hi>Fredericke Barbaroſſa</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth? Why did they draw on thoſe horrible confuſions which filled the weſt Empire with blood, ſacked many townes, and cauſed threeſcore maine battels to bee fought?</p>
                  <p>It is then a manifeſt corruption of the Scripture, when in the ſame place he produceth the Epiſtle of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaying to the Corinthians, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they ſhold go to law before vngodly men or Infidels, they ſhould erect thoſe who were of leaſt eſtimation in the Church, Iudges amongſt them: Then he addeth, <hi>Is it ſo, that there is not a wiſe man amongſt you, not one that can iudge betweene his brethren?</hi> From this Text <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maketh this collection, that the Corinthians might eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh new Iudges.

This is the expoſition that <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> giue vpon this place, and <hi>Lyranus</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> vpon this Epiſtle. Now if the Cardinall maintaine, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſpeake of forſaking the ordinary Iudges, to inſtitute new in their places, let him produce ſome examples hereof; let him ſhew vs the practiſe of it. There he is ſilent, and for good cauſe; for who maketh any doubt but that the Chriſtians, if they ſhould haue ſet vp ordinary Iudges in place of Imperiall Officers, ſhould haue beene held culpable of Leze-maieſty.</p>
                  <p>The danger which he pretendeth to be intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating an heretical King, cannot beare skale againſt the commaundement of God. Adde hereunto, that this reaſon is but weake in the mouth of a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite, who holdeth that a Pope,<note place="margin">Bellar. l. <hi>2.</hi> de Rom. Pont. c. <hi>29</hi>
                     </note> be he neuer ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and a deſtroyer of the Church, cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed no not by a general Councell; and yet there is greater apparant danger in this, then in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
                  <p>That which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> addeth, ſeemeth to haue beene written by him being aſleepe, and is nothing elſe but a quippe to make men laugh. He proueth that a faithfull people may free themſelues from the yoake of a Prince that is an Infidell, that is to ſay, may rebell againſt him, and that by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the beleeuing wife, which by the iudgement
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:11466:44"/>of the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. is not bound to abide with an husband that is an Infidell, when hee will not dwell with her. Whereunto I anſwere, firſt that Similitudes are no proofes: Secondly, this Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude being rightly taken doth not hurt vs: for as a beleeuing wife is not bound to follow her husband when he forſaketh her, and wil no longer co-habite with her; ſo I will freely confeſſe, that ſubiects are not bound to acknowledge a King, that abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his ſubiects, and will no longer be King ouer them, but renounceth his Realme: and this is all that may be drawne from this Compariſon. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this Similitude is aduantageous vnto vs; for if we admit the Compariſon betweene the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a wife and of ſubiects, then will it definitiuely determine our Controuerſie, and make vs gain the cauſe. For as while an husband that is an Infidell will abide with his beleeuing wife, ſhe may not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, nor ſhake off her yoake: ſo while a King that is an Infidell will retayne his ſoueraignty ouer beleeuing ſubiects, they may not abandone him nor rebell againſt him. The wordes of the Apoſtle are directly to this purpoſe: <hi>If any woman haue an vnbeleeuing husband, and he conſent to dwell with her, let her not forſake him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> addeth, is nothing elſe, but as his manner is, ſuppoſitions without proofes. We graunt him that Princes who againſt their promiſe, doe warre againſt the true fayth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to be depriued of their Kingdome; but wee denye that this power of depriuing them is in the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:11466:45"/>Pope. VVe muſt reſerue that iudgement to God, ſeeing it is he that hath eſtabliſhed them, and that (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſayth) they are inferiour to GOD alone.<note place="margin">Tertul. ad Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulam &amp; in Apolog. cap. <hi>30.</hi> A quo ſunt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundi, poſt quem primi.

                  <p>As touching theſe wordes ſpoken to S. PETER; <hi>Feed my ſheepe,</hi> to omit for the preſent that which S. AVSTIN ſayth in his booke of the Chriſtian combate; that Ieſus Chriſt, ſaying <hi>to S.</hi> Peter, <hi>Feede my lambes, ſpake the ſame to the rest;</hi> as all the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents with one accord doe ſay, that the power of binding and looſing was giuen to the Apoſtles, and to the whole Church in the perſon of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> to omit this, becauſe I will treat of it in his proper place: I onely ſay, that albeit this had beene ſpoken to the Pope, yet might he not for all that chaſtiſe Princes with depriuation of their eſtates, or by rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a commotion among his ſubiects, or by impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing fines and amercements vpon his countreyes. This is to enterprete the word <hi>Feede,</hi> too licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, we had neede of new Grammer for this new Diuinity: for the word Feede, which in times paſt ſignified to teach and to guide, dooth now a dayes ſignifie to blaſt whole kingdomes with the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of excommunications, to ouerthrow great Monarches, and to ſucke and draw out the very ſubſtance of the poore people. Beare with our ſimplicity herein; for ſo great an abuſe in wordes maketh vs to feare a greater in the matter it ſelfe. To ſpeake barbarouſly were an euill ſomewhat tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, were it not that Barbariſmes doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes paſſe into Hereſies, and incongruities in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:11466:45"/>wordes into incongruity in fayth. Thus the Biſhop of Rome calleth himſelfe the Pylot and Steer-man of S. <hi>Peters</hi> Shippe, but he imployeth that barke to trafficke his owne gayne, and S. <hi>Peters</hi> nets to fiſh for Princes Crownes, and to entramell whole States and Common-weales. His keyes now a dayes ſerue onely to open Cofers. His power of looſing only to looſe the bonds of fidelity, through a mutinous piety, and a factious Religion, which maketh it ſelf Iudge ouer the conſciences of kings, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> euen hateth their Religion becauſe it hateth their rule &amp; gouernment, and maketh, that to be a good ſubiect, &amp; to be a good Chriſtian, are things <hi>that cannot ſubſiſt together.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bellarmines</hi> reaſons hauing beene very feeble, the examples which he produceth in the Chapter following are leſſe currant. He ſayeth that <hi>Oſias</hi> king of Iuda was dryuen out of the Temple by the High Prieſt, and depryued of his kingdome. The text of Scripture is direct to the contrary. It is ſaid 2. <hi>King.</hi> 15.2. that <hi>Oſias</hi> began to raigne in the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth yeare of his age, and hee raigned fifty two yeates: ſo that he liued threeſcore and eyght years: whence it appeareth that he was King euen vntill his death. In the fift verſe <hi>Iotham</hi> his ſon during the time of his fathers ſeparation, becauſe of his lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, he is not called King but gouernor of his houſe. And <hi>ver.</hi> 7. the beginning of the raigne of <hi>Iotham</hi> is reckoned only from the death of <hi>Oſias</hi> his father.</p>
                  <p>The example of <hi>Athalia</hi> driuen from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by <hi>Iehoiada</hi> the high Prieſt is as little to the<note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 11.</note>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:11466:46"/>purpoſe. For wee ſpeake here of lawfull Princes depoſed, and he brings vs an example of a woman th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The example of S. <hi>Amboſe</hi> Biſhoppe of Millan, who would not receiue the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius</hi> to the communion, by reaſon of that great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which his ſouldiers, at his commaundement, committed at Theſſalonica, maketh expreſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Biſhop of Rome. For would the Pope now a dayes indure that a Biſhoppe of Millan or Colleyne ſhould intrude himſelfe to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Emperours, and to declare them to be fallen from their Empire without his permiſſion? Did <hi>Ambroſe</hi> this by the counſaile or commaundement of the Biſhop of Rome? And were it ſo that <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> had beene, that the Pope now ſayth himſelfe to be, where will <hi>Bellarmine</hi> finde that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> did degrade the Emperour, or that he diſpenſed with his ſubiects for the Oath of fidelity? Let a man read his three and thirtieth Epiſtle, and he ſhall ſee with how great humilty he ſubmitteth himſelfe to an Arrian Emperour, ſo farre from preaching any reuolt of his ſubiects from him, that indeede hee willingly offered to dye, and to ſuffer perſecution, if ſuch were the will of the Emperour. As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the law which <hi>Theodoſius</hi> impoſed vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by the Counſell of S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> which was that from thence forward he would ſtay the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:11466:46"/>of any ſentence of death vntil the thirtieth day. I cannot ſee how this can ſerue to giue vnto the Pope power of depoſing Princes; For if <hi>Theodoſius</hi> would not haue followed the counſell of <hi>Ambroſe;</hi> there had beene no harme done. But this good Emperour did of his owne accord yeeld vnto it.</p>
                  <p>After him followeth <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt; at the end of whoſe Epiſtles is found a priuiledge graunted to the Abbey of S. <hi>Medard,</hi> which hath this clauſe for the burthen of the Song: <hi>If any King, Prelate, Iudge, or ſecular perſon what ſoeuer ſhall violate the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of this Apoſtolicall authority, and of our comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, be he of what dignity or greatnes ſoeuer he may be, let him be depriued of his honour.</hi> I might ſay that this is onely an imprecation againſt Kings, and not a Decree of depoſition. But we neede not buſie our ſelues about the ſenſe, ſeeing that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle is falſe. It is a priuiledge indeed vnto which the name of <hi>Gregory</hi> is put, to winne the greater credite and authority. The falſhood of it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth firſt in the Barbariſme of the ſtyle; for men did neuer call, neyther at Rome nor in Italy, farmes or poſſeſſions by the name of <hi>Manſos.</hi> It is a word which is found in the Chapter of <hi>Charles</hi> the great, and of <hi>Lewes,</hi> which ſheweth that this priuiledge was firſt compoſed in France, and not written at Rome. Which thing alſo appeareth in this that he vſeth theſe wordes: <hi>Tuſiacum &amp; Mortinetum fiſcos regios.</hi> To call the lands of the Kings Demaines, <hi>Fiſcos regios</hi> is a Barbariſme that may eaſily befall ſome French monke; but at Rome this would not
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:11466:47"/>haue beene vnderſtood: and you eſpye the French vaine in theſe wordes very often repeated, <hi>Dominus Medardus, Monſieur S. Medard.</hi> Adde hereunto that this priuiledge is abſurd and vniuſt; for it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddes to depoſe the Abbot of S. Medard howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer attainted with crime, vnleſſe it be after the Popes pleaſure known, and after a Councel aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, wherein there ſhall bee found a douſen wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, beſides the accuſers. Now to breake this goodly priueledge is thought to bee a crime, for which a King ought to looſe his Kingdome. The cheef poynt is, that the humor of this <hi>Gregorie</hi> the firſt, who called himſelfe ſeruant of ſeruants, doth very much diſagree with theſe ſo arrogant terms; &amp; which cut after the ſtile of an earthly Monarch. For writing to <hi>Mauricius</hi> the Emperor in his third booke and ſixt Epiſtle: <hi>But I the vnworthy ſeruant of your goodneſſe.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ego autem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignus pietatis tuae ſeruus.

For an
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:11466:47"/>vpſhot of falſhoods; ſo at the end of this goodly priuiledge the ſubſcriptions of the Biſhops of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria and Carthage, who neuer knew the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey of S. <hi>Medard,</hi> eſpecially the Biſhop of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, who neuer ſaw <hi>Gregory,</hi> and who beſide that ſigneth his name very low among the thronge of ordinary witneſſes, albeit he neuer thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe inferiour in any thing to the Biſhop of Rome. After all ſigneth King <hi>Theodoret</hi> as inferiour to all the Biſhops.</p>
                  <p>After this <hi>Gregory,</hi> wee are brought downe to <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſecond, the great puller downe of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. If we may beleeue <hi>Cedrenus</hi> and <hi>Zonaras</hi> great adorers of Images: this <hi>Gregory</hi> went about to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Italians from paying their tributes to <hi>Leo Iſauricus,</hi> who had demoliſhed Images. But <hi>Platina</hi> who hath moſt carefully ſearched out the ſtory of Popes, witneſſeth the contrary, and ſayth in the life of this <hi>Gregory,</hi> that vpon order giuen from the Emperour for the breaking downe of Images. <hi>The people of Italy were ſo much moued,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Qua cohortatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne adeo animati ſunt Italiae popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livt Paulum abfuerit quin ſibi alium Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deligerent Quo minus a, id fieret authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ſua obſtare Gregorius ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseſt.</note> 
                     <hi>that it wanted but little, but that they had choſen themſelues another Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour: but</hi> Gregory <hi>employed his authority to hinder that matter.</hi> Nay further he neuer for all that, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <hi>Leo</hi> fallen from the Empire, he did not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his Scepter to another, he did not diſpenſe with his ſubiects for their Oath of Alleageance: And yet the Emperour at that time did onely hold a third part of Italy, which was a very ſmall porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Empire; ſo that his tributes of Italy were vnto him of very little value.</p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:11466:48"/>
                  <p>As for Pope <hi>Zacharie,</hi> when they report in the yeare 750 to haue taken from <hi>Childeriche</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Fraunce to giue vnto <hi>Pipin;</hi> and likewiſe Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the third, whom men ſay to haue tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Empire of the Greekes to the French by giuing the Empire to <hi>Charlemaine.</hi> I could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince all this of falſhood, and ſhew that the practiſe and cuſtome of Popes is to giue vnto ſome one, that thing which he cannot take from him; Or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hauing incyted ſome one to inuade the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his neighbour, to vaunt afterward, and to reproach him; that what he got by rapine he now holdeth by his Holineſſe liberality; or as if in the Sacring of the Emperour, becauſe he hath put the Crowne on his head, he ſhould ſay that he hath giuen him the Empire; as if in the ſacring of a King he that hath inaugurated him by performing the Ceremony ſhould bragge that he hath giuen him the Kingdome. By this reaſon the Biſhop of Oſtias, who hath had for a long time the right of conſecrating the Pope, ſhould haue bin aboue the Popes: and the Biſhop of Millan ſhould giue the Kingdome of Italy to the Emperour, becauſe from him he is to receiue a Crowne of Iron: but this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to another diſcourſe, neyther is the proofe of it neceſſary to this purpoſe. For had theſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops done much worſe then this, yet could not their example ſerue for a rule, vnleſſe it be ſhewed where and when God gaue them this power. For is it credible that the Biſhops of Rome could haue had in their hands this power neare eight hundred
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:11466:48"/>yeares together without enploying it? or that they ſuffered this temporall ſworde to hang ruſting on a pinne, without euer making vſe of it, vntill that after many ages this <hi>Zachary</hi> bethought himſelfe of putting it to ſeruice in an action which the Church of Rome it ſelfe confeſſeth to bevniuſt? Seeing that the Canon <hi>Alius,</hi> before aleadged, ſayth, that <hi>Childericke</hi> was not depoſed for any cryme, but becauſe <hi>Pipin</hi> was more capable of gouernement then he. How many Emperours and Kings vnfit to gouerne were there before this <hi>Childericke,</hi> whoſe Crownes the Popes neuer tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched? But this Pope flattered <hi>Pipin</hi> to the end to be ſuccoured by him againſt the Lumbards, who kept him in ſeruitude.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſhut vp this whole matter, ſeeing that the Pope doth challenge to himſelfe this power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Kings, who is it that hath giuen it vnto him? Is it from the vnwritten worde? Is it a cuſtome au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed by the time? or ſuffered by Princes? or ſlid it along by the fauour and ſleepineſſe of an age that liued in darkeneſſe? Or if God hath giuen him this power, let him produce his Title, let him ſhew the clauſes of this Donation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Againe, If Chriſt left a Succeſſour or Liefte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant here on earth, it is certayne that he can exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe no other charge then that which Ieſus Chriſt did, being in the world. Now he did neuer degrade Kings, nor tranſlate Empyres. Nay how is it like he would haue done that, ſeeing that he could not be intreated to become a Iudge betweene priuate
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:11466:49"/>men in a Controuerſie that was of ciuill nature. He that teacheth vs to yeelde tribute to <hi>Caeſar</hi> is it likely that hee would haue left a Lieftenant that ſhould make <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelfe tributary.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If it be ſo, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> or any other Apoſtle had this power ouer Kingdomes: where dooth it appeare that euer he exerciſed it? And to what end ſerueth an authority without the execution? Or where did this power of the Biſhops ouer the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porality of Kings lie couring all this while, that it ſhould need to be rouzed vp ſome eleuen hundred yeares after Ieſus Chriſt?</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Moreouer, It is God that giueth Kings and Princes their power, as <hi>Daniel</hi> told <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> though an Infidel.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.37.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou O King art a King of Kings, becauſe the God of heauen hath giuen thee a Kingdome, and power, and ſtrength, and glory.</hi> And the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. hath tolde vs that all powers are orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God. Now that which God giueth, man cannot take away. Let the Pope take away if it pleaſe him, that which himſelfe hath giuen: let him take his Cardinals redde hattes, Archbiſhops pals, if euer he gaue any without money; Let him giue out againſt them that holde Benefices from him, that their Benefices are deuolted vnto him by lapſe, but let him abſtaine from the Crowes of Kings, let him not touch the Lords annoynted.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Adde hereunto thoſe paſſages which the King of great Britaine hath learnedly obſerued in his Apology, by which he proueth, that God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth that his pleople yeelde obedience to Kings e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

But wee now a dayes ſtand vpon better termes: for if wee ought to obey a Prince that is a Pagan, euen for conſcience ſake in Ciuill cauſes; how much more one that is truely a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian? And if a Tygre that hath climed to the top of the Empire, how much more a Prince that is wiſe and mercifull, who preſerueth the liues of thoſe that deſire his death? And if we may not obey any man that leadeth and commaundeth a mutiny and treaſon; how much leſſe ought we to obey the Pope, whoſe Empire is founded vpon the ruines of the Goſpell, and who being prodigall of the blood of thoſe who are his, draweth perſecution vpon them, to the end that they for him may looſe goods and life, yea and life eternall?</p>
                  <p>Now if any man vnwilling to enter this liſt, ſhal ſay that this is a matter of pollicy, and that we prye into matters of State; ſuch a one by his tergiuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:11466:50"/>wil more ouerthrow the Popes power, then if hee had expreſly fought againſt it.

The Pope then is to blame for making ſuch bragges of his keyes in this caſe, if it be nothing but a matter of pollicy, and ſuch as hath no ſparke of Diuinity in it: which thing Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the fift, doth couertly confeſſe in the extrauagant <hi>Meruit:</hi>

For in this extrauagant (which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> dooth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue and commend) Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> foundeth his pretenſions ouer the Temporalties of Princes, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon many paſſages of the word of God. He mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth then that his right is by the lawe of God: where againſt King <hi>Philip</hi> hedoth maintaine, that in temporal things he is ſubiect to no man. Within
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:11466:50"/>a while after <hi>Clement</hi> the fift paſſed it ſo, in fauor of the King, and exempted him from the rigour of this Bull; the Pope then made bolde to diſpenſe with the law of God: or if on the other ſide it be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but an humane poſitiue law, then <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> dealt very wickedly in ſeeking to ground it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the holy Scripture. But why ſhall Fraunce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone be exempted from this yoake and other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes ſhall be enforced to beare it? Could <hi>Philips</hi> merites diſpenſe with him for obeying the word of God produced by <hi>Boniface.</hi> Theſe Popes make a Religion of waxe, depending vpon the conditions of the times, and the traine of their affaires, and make it a prop of their Dominion: they ſtretch it and ſhorten it like a ſtirrup leather, fitting not their wils to Religion, but Religion to their will. Now if <hi>Philip</hi> had bin Maſter of Rome and abſolutecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Italy, the Biſhops of Rome would haue thrown themſelues on their knees before him, as did Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> in the ſecond Counſell of Nice, 2. Act. and would haue called themſelues wormes, duſt, and his petty-ſeruants as did <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt, writing to <hi>Mauricius.</hi>

                  <p>To theſe words, ſo full of weight and euidence, <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> anſwereth very ſoftly and ſillily. He ſaith that Catholicke Kings, do not apprehend any ſuch calamitie, ſeeing that amongſt them Eccleſiaſticall Perſons liue vnder their Lawes and acknowledge their authority, euen the Pope himſelfe beeing aware of it: That in France the Cardinals and By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops performe vnto the King, the Oath of Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth the Kings for hauing giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Clerks great immunities, notwithſtanding which he ſayth that they doe not let to be bound to ciuill Lawes.</p>
                  <p>Theſe wordes are full of timerouſneſſe and lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ambiguity.<label type="milestone">

                     </label> Hee ſaith that Clerkes indeede liue vnder the lawes of Princes, but hee doth not tell vs, that in caſe of diſobedience the King may puniſh them; for otherwiſe there is no ſubiection. He ſayth that the Biſhops yeeld the Oath of Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but the queſtion now is not touching fidelity, but touching ſubiection and obedience. He ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of immunities granted by Princes, but he doth not tel vs what theſe immunities be; for this is one (as <hi>Bellarm.</hi> witneſſeth and we will ſhew hereafter) that Clerks are no longer ſubiects to Kings, &amp; that the King is no longer their Superiour. Thus can we learne nothing of this Doctor.</p>
                  <p>So that indeede his Maieſties complaint is ſo iuſt, that if we holde our peace threin, the cauſe wil proclaime it ſelfe: Euery man knoweth what a
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:11466:52"/>Diminution to the Crowne and greatneſſe of Kings, theſe immunities of Clergy men do bring; all which they couer and rabble vp vnder the Title of the liberty of the Church, vnworthily tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this ſacred name of Chriſtian liberty, which ſignifieth in the word of God the deliuerance from the curſe and malediction, and from the yoake of ſinne, and from the heauy burthen of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the law; to ciuill pretences, and diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with that naturall duety which wee owe vnto our Prince, vnder whom we had the happineſſe firſt to behold the <hi>Sunne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a thing that belongeth euen to the law of Nations: and beſides that is authoriſed by the word of God, that euery perſon be ſubiect to the Soueraigne Magiſtrate. But here now ſee, how in one kingdome, as in Fraunce, there will be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue three hundred thouſand perſons, who vnder the title of Clergy-men haue ſhaken off the yoake of the Princes authority; yea euen children that are entred Nouices into that Body, exempted from all obedience towards their parents:</p>
                  <p>This body of the Clergie hath its Iudges and officers &amp; their priſons likewiſe apart. Their cauſes are not called to be anſwered before Royall Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; but receiue hearing and determination in the great State chamber at Rome called <hi>La Zuota</hi> or in the conſiſtorie.</p>
                  <p>There is a third parte of the Lands of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the hands of Clergy men to the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice of our kings. For it often commeth to paſſe,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:11466:52"/>that the proprietarie owners and poſſeſſors of lands doe ſell their inheritances; whence accureth profite to the Prince, by the Kings fine which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of euery firſt part, or firſt prime, of ſuch fales and other rights belonging to the cheefe Lord; which Rights are loſt when once immoueable goods, enter into the poſſeſſion of the Clergy. The king doth alſo loſe his right of Aubaine, which is an eſcheate to the king of all ſuch goods, as any ſtranger dying in Fraunce is poſſeſſed of, alſo the right of confiſcation, and in caſe of deſertion when a man doth quit his owne eſtate. The Clergy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a body that neuer dyeth, that neuer confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, and in which body inheritances dye by Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine: Vpon whom the ſecular perſons conferre euery day new Donations; but we neuer ſee the ſharing of Eccleſiaſticall goods made to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite and behoofe of any Lay-man: for goods finde many gates open to enter into the Clergy, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a one to get our from thence, like thoſe foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the wilde beaſts, which all turned inward towards the Lyons denne, but there appeared no trace of any that euer returned from thence. And hence it commeth to paſſe, that as in mans body, the thighs and armes grow leſſe and leſſe by how much the bigger the belly ſwelleth through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe: ſo in the body of a Common wealth. The Nobility and the Commonalty, who are as the armes and legges of that State, they are brought low by the increaſe of the Clergy.</p>
                  <p>To this end alſo they haue obtained that the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:11466:53"/>Church ſhal alwayes be held in non-age and in her minority, that if ſhe ſhall at any time haue made promiſe or contract, that may turne to her diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, ſhe may vnder that pretence be releeued. And whereas in common courſe of law, thirtie yeeres are ſufficient to keepe poſſeſſion by way of Preſcription:<note place="margin">De Praeſcript. Cap. <hi>2.</hi> in Serto. Contra ipſam Romanam Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiam Cente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naria. vel contra alias Eccleſias quadragenaria preſcriptro Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitima ſit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleta.</note> Againſt the Church of Rome, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Templaries no Preſcription can be of force vnder one hundred yeares; which is in effect as much as that againſt them there is no Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The other Churches and Orders haue fortie yeares Preſcription.</p>
                  <p>This ought alſo moreouer to be added, which is a thing that doth greatly redound to the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the power of kings. And that is, that al Fee-farms and lands of the moſt noble Tenure, aſſoone as they enter into the Poſſeſſion of Eccleſiaſticall perſons, they become exempted from all charges and payments, as well in regard of their perſons as of their goods, being no longer bound to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall ſeruice, which the poſſeſſour formerly owed vnto the Prince. Whence it came to paſſe that our auncient kings were able within leſſe circuite of Countrey, to leuie Armies of an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, whereas now a dayes within a farre lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger extent, fewer troupes are gathered, becauſe there is a third part of the lands of Fraunce, which contribute nothing to publique neceſſities. And yet notwithſtanding, naturall reaſon requireth that they who enioy the fruite and benefite of peace, ſhould contribute toward the warre; that thoſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:11466:53"/>that liue at caſe, ſhould cheriſh and releeue them that fight for their conſeruation. Wherefore then whiles the Nobility and the third State, do oppoſe themſelues to the inuaſion of ſtrangers, whiles the King doth fortifie his Frontiere Townes; doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine Gariſons, dooth appoint Officers as well for ciuill gouernement as for diſcipline of warre; why ſhould not Eccleſiaſticall perſons, who by theſe meanes doe quietly enioy the fat and beſt of the Kingdome, why ſhould not they, I ſay, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the publicke neceſſity: why ſhould their increaſe be a deminution to their Princes forces, who watcheth ouer them for their quiet?</p>
                  <p>Furthermore no man can be ignorant but that this is a thing greatly threatning the dammage and impoueriſhing of the Kingdome, that a third part of Fraunce ſhould be tributary to a ſtranger, vnder a title of <hi>Annates, Dates,</hi> Diſpenſations, Abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and caſes of marriage. Againſt all which bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting extortion our auncient Kings prouided by the <hi>Pragmaticke Sanction;</hi> being angryed and agreeued to ſee the faire pence of the Kingdome to paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Alpes vnder a Religious kinde of pillage, and to enter into the purſes of thoſe who made a mocke at our ſimplicity.</p>
                  <p>But aboue all, this is that which is moſt perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Kings and their eſtates, that ſo many perſons are exempted from iuſtice, and from the arme of the ſecular power. For by this meanes if a Clerke doe himſelfe vndertake, or doe abet another to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt againſt the life of his Prince, if he coyne falſe
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:11466:54"/>money, ſet fire on a towne, or entertaine ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence with ſtrangers; or if hee infect the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people by the example of his lewde manners. The Prince for all this cannot lay handes on him without leaue from his Biſhop, and hee ſhall not dare to touch him, vntil he be firſt degraded, in ſuch ſort that the King hath in his kingdome an infinite number of perſons, who are Lords of the faireſt and beſt choyce of his Countrey, and who are not his ſubiects, but do acknowledge another for their Superiour out of the kingdome.</p>
                  <p>This is verily one of the boldeſt wiles and the ſubtileſt ſleights of the myſtery of iniquity, to haue found out a meanes whereby to make a king by ſufferance to giue way to another, to eſtabliſh an eſtate within his owne eſtate, and in the end to thanke him for it too: and to thinke himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to him for the ſame. Who will then mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell hereupon, if the king of great Britaine whom God hath freed from ſo heauy a yoake, doe looke with compaſſion vpon thoſe other kingdomes, who yet do groane vnder this burthen, and as ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſafe on the ſhoare, giueth aduiſe and counſell to his brethren whom he ſeeth weather-beaten with theſe ſurges, and carryed away with the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of an olde inueterate cuſtome.</p>
                  <p>Now here I proteſt againe, as heretofore I haue done, that I doe not ſpeake of the perſons, but of the rules and orders of the Church of Rome. I know that in this great body of the Clergy there is a great number that would willingly dye for the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:11466:54"/>ſeruice of their king: in whom their Prieſtly chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of ſhauing, hath not made them forget that they are borne ſubiects. In whoſe ſpirits nature hath more force then their habites, and the loue of their Countrey more then the Maximes of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but they are beholden to their owne good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions for this, and not to the rules of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Some to colour this abuſe, ſay that Clerkes are exempted from the power of Princes not by Gods law, but onely by mans poſitiue law: whereunto I ſay that firſt they contradict not onely <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe, who in his booke of the exemption of Clerkes,<note place="margin">Eccleſiae Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticae<expan>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly I ſay that it little importeth Princes vnder what title men take away their dues, ſeeing that they are eyther way alike riffeled and deſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. And it goeth againſt the heart of him that hath been robbed to pay himſelfe with a diſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, certaine it is that if this be graunted, that the exemptions of Clerkes is founded onely vpon mans lawes: yet if a Prince ſhould goe about to clippe the priuiledges of Church-men, and ſhould continue on, to draw thoſe rights and dues vppon their lands which he had vpon them whiles they
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:11466:55"/>were yet in the hands of ſecular men; ſuch a Prince I ſay, ſhall be neuer a whit the more excuſed: nay, rather he ſhall be curſed and banned as blacke as a coale, and ſhall be ground to powder with hote excommunications, as a perſecutor and diminiſher of the liberty of the Church. And if any Ieſuite ſhould come to ſuffer death in any ſuch quarrel, he ſhould be put in the Kalendar of Saints and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirs, as was <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who ſuffered on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for this very ſubiect.</p>
                  <p>And indeede it is a thing very eaſie for vs to prooue that Clerkes haue exempted themſelues from Taxes and Subſidies and Contributions, and from ſubiection to the ſecular ſword, not onely without all law, both of God and man, but directly contrary to Gods Diuine law. For S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. will haue euery ſoule ſubiect to the higher powers. He that will exempt Clerkes from this rule, ſaith by a conſequent that they haue no ſoule. Now if they be ſubiect, then doe they owe Tribute: for S. <hi>Paul</hi> addeth, that this ſubiection conſiſteth in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of tribute: <hi>For this cauſe</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>you pay tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, becauſe they are the Miniſters of God.</hi>

So, all that men are wont to alleadge out of the auncient Councels, authoriſing theſe exemptions, may ſerue indeede to exhort Clerkes to addreſſe themſelues to their Biſhops to compoſe their differents in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call matters. But now a dayes to exempt Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands from paying taxe and Subſidy; nor to take from the Magiſtrate the power of puniſhing any Clerke that is a wicked man, and attaynted of ſome cryme which is puniſhable by the law.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſay that Clerkes cannot be iudged
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:11466:57"/>by the validity of their owne exemptions, ſeeing they are made altogether in fauour of them, and to their owne profite. And being Iudges and parties, they will take heed, I trow, of condemning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
                  <p>I ſay further; for I mayntaine this truth, That Princes cannot free Clergy men from their ciuill ſubiection and obedience, ſeeing that God himſelfe hath ſubiected them thereunto. So a father can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not free his children from that due obedience which they owe vnto him: Neyther can he by any damnable induldence and facility toward his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, looſe thoſe bands of nature which God moreouer alloweth and authorizeth in his word. That good indeed, or that good turne is iniurious, that byndeth a man to doe ill, or that exempteth him from well doing. And not to ſpeake but of Magiſtrates only, I ſay, that God hauing comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Iſraelites to ſubdue the Cananites and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhites, and to make them their ſeruants: They ſhould haue offended God if they had let them goe free and at liberty.</p>
                  <p>I leaue this alſo to any mans iudgement, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Prince may take any Donations, by the which both himſelfe and his Succeſſors may looſe the third part of their Dominion. If any man be an angryed with his money, he may giue it away, and make hauocke of it if he pleaſe, but he cannot binde his poſterity to the like humour. Neyther can his perſonall liberalities make vniuerfall Lawes: Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when by experien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e it is knowne to be true,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:11466:58"/>that thoſe perſons on whom the good deedes haue beene done, doe waxe the worſe by them, and the benefites extended towards them, corrupt in their owne boſomes. For, not to ſpeake of thoſe many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold vices which haue thronged in at this gate by troupes, Clergy-men are become very ill acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgers of thoſe good deedes which Princes haue conferred on them: For now they maintayne, that theſe immunities belong vnto them by Gods law, and by Diuine right; and that they holde all this from God and not from man, and that the Pope hauing exempted Clergy-men from the ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Princes, they are no more their ſubiects, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are Princes any longer their ſuperiours. This doctrine is conſtantly vpheld in Rome, and mayn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayned by all the Doctors that are of any marke in that Church. But about all, by the leſuites; diuers of whoſe teſtimomes, touching this point, we haue heretofore produced.</p>
                  <p>Out auncient Kings neuer heard of any ſuch propoſitions in their dayes. And without doubt that which now-a dayes is called in our law, <hi>Le droit de Regale,</hi> and <hi>L'appell comme d'abus,</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Inhibition of the Annates, by the pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Sanction (of which there remayneth no more now-a-dayes then the bare name) theſe are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of the auncient power of our Kings, by the which they did diſpoſe of Eccleſiaſticall mens goods, as well as of Secular perſons. But now-a-dayes after a lamentable manner of ſpeaking, and iniuri ous to our Kings, theſe things are called <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:11466:58"/>of the Gallicane Church.</hi> As if for a man not to be robbed or riffeled, were a priuiledge vnto him. Or as if it were a ſpeciall grace graunted by the Pope, that a man ſhould haue power to be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in his owne houſe, <hi>Non eſt Priuilegium ſed pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilegium.</hi> And yet this priuiledge is not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
                  <p>And hereupon I beſeech the Reader to conſider how handſomely Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth carry himſelfe in this poynt, who in the eight and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth chapter of his booke of Clerkes,<note place="margin">§ Secunda.</note> to the end to gratifie Princes with ſomething, he will, that Clerkes ſhould conforme themſelues, to ciuill lawes in certaine menial ſmall things, as in the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any Merchandize, or not to go abroad in the night without a Lanthorne. But within a ſhort ſpace after, he plucketh backe, all that which before he had giuen, willing them to be ſubiects indeede,<note place="margin">

That is to ſay, that they may be commanded, but not conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to yeeld obedience: they ſhall obey as farre as themſelues liſt: and this is not to be a ſubiect in any regard. That law is no lawe that onely hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their diſcretion for whom it is enacted.

And farther ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that the matters wherein he maketh the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie ſubiect to the law, are trifles, and things of no moment.

The warres of the Normanes came then ſuddenly vpon them, which ſet the Emperours about other buſineſſe: and the Sea of Rome began then to grow to that ouerflowing and diſorder, that for the full ſpace of two hundred yeares, there was nothing to bee ſeene but ſlaughter, theft, adulterie, forcery, and one Pope degrading and thruſting out another: in which time by <hi>Coeffeteau's</hi> owne confeſſion many Maſters ſate in the Pontificall chayre; and it is pleaſant reading to peruſe the Councel of Rhemes held vnder <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> about that affaire.

                        <hi>Fol.</hi> 16. <hi>pag</hi> 2</note> And he ſaith well: for in the beginning the Biſhop of Rome medled not with the election of the Emperours: hee did not pull downe Kingdomes: he impoſed no Annates, or tyrannous impoſitions vpon the Clergy: hee intermedled not with temporall affaires, neither did his Eccleſiaſtical authority extend farther then the Churches and pariſhes in the Suburbs; that is,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:11466:62"/>no farther then the Prouoſt-ſhip and Iuriſdiction of the Citie of Rome: he was not called the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the world, nor the head of the Vniuerſall Church, nor God vpon the earth, nor did he weare a triple Crowne, nor made the Kings to kiſſe his feet, nor did he vaunt that he could not erre in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of faith: but as faſt as the Emperours did fall, ſo faſt did the Popes riſe: and I aſſure my ſelfe, that the Pope would rather renounce his ſucceſſion of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> then the Donation of <hi>Charlemaine.</hi>

And indeede <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> confeſſeth that the Emperour <hi>Constantius</hi> medled both with the election of <hi>Foelix,</hi> and with the depoſing of <hi>Liberius</hi> Biſhop of Rome: but he ſaith that he was an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, and that S. <hi>Hilarie</hi> cal'd him Antichriſt: which notwithſtanding diſables not the authority of this example: for if <hi>Liberius</hi> had beene then an Arrian, as hee became afterwards, no man could haue thought it ſtrange, that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> had expelled him, and aduanced another of the Orthodoxe faith into his roome. S. <hi>Hilary</hi> blamed him, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he medled with the depoſing, or election of a Biſhop, but becauſe in <hi>Liberius</hi> he perſecuted the truth: which may be as well ſaid of the Kings of the Gothes, fauourers of Arrianiſme, which made and vnmade the Biſhop of Rome at their pleaſure: And it is principally to be conſidered, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours tooke leſſe heede to the chooſing of the Roman Biſhops as long as they preached the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell themſelues, and were contented with the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of being Paſtors of the City of Rome, and did not thruſt their Eccleſiaſticall ſicle into the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall harueſt. But aſſoone as they began to ſpeake
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:11466:64"/>bigge, and to meddle with ciuill affaires, and that when matters were doubtfully ballanced, they were like a great ſtone in one of the ſcales, who can wonder if the Emperours b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <q>His Maieſty of England alleadgeth to the ſame purpoſe, the example of <hi>Philip le bel</hi> K. of France, that wrote with liberty enough vnto <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> the eight, who firſt inuented the Iubile,<note place="margin">Platina Stella.</note> in theſe wordes: <hi>Let your great folleſhip vnderſtand,

The ſaid King ſaith farther, that the facultie of Sorbone, came to maintaine this point, that if the Pope ſhould offer violence to our King, the French Church had authority to eſtabliſh a Patriarch, and ſeuer themſelues from the See of Rome. And that <hi>Gerſon</hi> Chaunceller of the Vniuerſitie of Paris, was ſo farre from defending this preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded temporall power of the Popes, that he wrote a booke <hi>De auferibilitate Papae ab Eccleſia;</hi> that is, <hi>Of the poſsibility of forſaking the Pope, and remoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him from the Church.</hi> How much more did hee beleeue then that the temporall power of Kings might be free from the inſulting of Papall authority?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this doth <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> make no other anſwere,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:11466:67"/>but that theſe contentions were onely for tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall matters; and that <hi>Philip</hi> or <hi>Lewes,</hi> or the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> or the Kings Aduocate, deſired not to preiudice the Popes authority in any regard, as he is head of the Church; ſo that here, he anſweres well to the King of Englands queſtion; whoſe ayme is onely vnto matters temporall, and to the vſurpation of Popes ouer Monarches. Touching the title of Head of the Church, which is an abuſe more intollerable, hee reſerues that for an after-diſcourſe. Now if ſo be, the diſſention betweene <hi>Philip</hi> and the See of Rome continued not many yeares, as <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> obſerueth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Fol.</hi> 22 <hi>pag</hi> 2</note> it was becauſe the Pope gaue way vnto him: and <hi>Benedict</hi> the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth was very glad to giue <hi>Philip</hi> abſolution,<note place="margin">Platina Stella.</note> which he graunted of his owne accord, becauſe the other might haue beene well without it.</p>
                  <p>That we may cloſe vp this point, the King of great Britaine drawes many examples out of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Paris,</hi> and out of the Records of his Kingdom to this purpoſe; as <hi>William Gifford</hi> whom King <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt inueſted with his Biſhopricke, and <hi>Rodulphus</hi> whom the ſame King inueſted with the Archbiſhopricke of Canterbury by his Ring and Croſier-ſtaffe: and <hi>Thurſtan</hi> nominated to the Archbiſhopricke of Yorke, depriued by the King of his temporalties, for corrupting with bribes the Popes agents in the Councell of Rhemes. The ſaid King alleadgeth many examples of Abbots, Biſhops and Deanes in England, that haue eyther againſt the Popes will, yeelded obedience to their
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:11466:68"/>Soueraignes, or haue beene degraded, cenſured and impriſoned by their Princes for their diſobedience in adhaering to the Popes And which is more conſiderable, theſe are late examples, ſuch as haue happened while the Papacy domineered moſt: How ſtood the caſe then, when the Biſhoppe of Rome had nothing to doe in England, with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters eyther temporall or ſpirituall? The Kingdome of Fraunce doth furniſh vs with examples of more pregnancy. The Synode of Fraunce is of ſpeciall note to this purpoſe, which is to be found in the third Tome of the Councels of the Colleyn Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>pag.</hi> 39. where <hi>Carolomanus</hi> qualifying himſelfe as Duke and Prince of Fraunce vſeth this ſpeach, <hi>By the aduiſe of my Clergie, and others of principall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of the Realme,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ordinauimus Epiſcopos.</note>

                  <p>And here let it be principally noted, that <hi>Coeffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau</hi> truſts more to his heeles, then to his hands: for he buckles onely with the firſt of theſe examples; and all his anſwere is, that <hi>Anſelme</hi> Archbiſhop of Canterbury oppoſed this courſe. But to this I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that for this oppoſition he was forged both to forſake England, and quit his Biſhopricke. The
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:11466:68"/>contradiction of one of the Popes penſionary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates oppoſing his Soueraigne, is of ſmall moment in this behalfe; for <hi>Anſelme</hi> was accounted the Popes, not the Kings ſubiect. Nor is it any greater wonder if <hi>Mathew Paris,</hi> who ſo often magnifies this King <hi>Henry,</hi> doe now and then caſt ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation vpon him: in as much as he was a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Monke, and liued ſoone after: who in euery paſſage complaining of the tyrannie and exactions of the Popes, doth yet ſometimes reſtrain himſelfe for ſome idle reſpects, in which he oftener gropes for the truth, then he doth ſee or finde it.</p>
                  <p>We muſt alſo obſerue, that the principall quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell betweene the King of England and the Pope being for inueſting men with ſpirituall promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Pope hath beſtowed very glorious Titles on thoſe perſons, that ſuffered for this quarrell: as if he ſhould write <hi>Rubarbe,</hi> vpon a pot of <hi>Rats-bane.</hi> So hath he placed this <hi>Anſelme</hi> in the Kalender of Saints, and Confeſſours; and <hi>Thomas</hi> of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury in the Catalogue of Martyrs, that loſt his life, not for the profeſſion of the Goſpell, but for a Controuerſie of Prebends, and the right of Inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> doth here adde, <hi>That the Kings of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in the matter of ordination of Prieſts haue neuer violated the Diſcipline of the Church:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The King of England al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgeth theſe and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examples of like nature.</note> And I ſuppoſe that hee had not vouchſafed the reading of the booke, againſt which he writes. For the Kings book ſaith that <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, inueſted an Archbiſhop in his Archbiſhopricke with his Ringe and Croſier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaffe,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:11466:69"/>without the Popes leaue, which is flat repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the diſcipline of the Church of Rome.<note place="margin">

                  <p>To conclude, our Doctor ſayth, that <hi>Henry the first did in other things ſubmit himſelfe to the lawes of the Church; that in the Records of England, moſt of the monuments ſpeake of yeelding obedience to the See Apoſtolique: that his Maieſtie embraceth a Religion which his Predeceſſors neuer poſſeſſed, but haue euer acknowledged the authority of Rome in all matters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending vpon matter of conſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, I anſwere, that this is to wander from the queſtion, for heere is nothing queſtioned but the Popes Supremacy ouer Kings in matters tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: Secondly, that barely to affirme, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme nothing, eſpecially writing againſt a King, doth eyther diſcouer much weakeneſſe, or argue ouer-much neglect: and indeede his whole alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is vntrue. Concerning <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, I confeſſe, that he aſcribed too much honour to the Church of Rome; for he liued in a dark &amp; ignorant age, and in the height of the Popes tyranny, to which England of all Countries was moſt enthral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: which cannot bee proued of the times more
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:11466:69"/>auncient. It may well appeare, that the Citie of Rome, being the ſeat of the Empire, was by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the reſort of all nations; by which meanes the Church of that citie, how poore and miſerable ſoeuer, might haue aduertiſements from all parties, and haue intelligence with all the Churches within the Empire, and conſequently which is the Church of great Brittaine; which was originally planted by ſome of S <hi>Iohn.</hi> Diſciples that came thither out of Aſia: whereof we haue this proofe, that euen to the time of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was ſent into England by <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogorie</hi> the firſt about the yere 596. the Church of the Iland, did keepe the feaſt of Eaſter, according to the cuſtome of Aſia, vpon the 14. day of the month, which if it had beene vnder the iuriſdiction of the Biſhop of Rome, no queſtion but it had abrogated that cuſtome, when <hi>Victor,</hi> in the yeare 200. did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate the Churches which made any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe obſeruation of the 14. day. <hi>Helene</hi> mother vnto <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> was of the Iland, and held no points of Papiſtrie maintained at this day. <hi>Pelagius</hi> was alſo of this Iland, and ſauing the points of free will, and originall ſinne, diſſented not in any opinions from S. <hi>Anguſtine.</hi> Now S. <hi>Anguſtine</hi> receiued no Popiſh opinions now defended; as we haue proued in the 20. chapter of my booke of the Euchariſt in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place,<note place="margin">In the twenty Chapter of my booke of the Euchariſt. <hi>Pontificus Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumnius lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Jo.

                     </note> that he died excommunicate from the Church of Rome The firſt Chriſtian King of great Brittaine that can be remembred, was <hi>Lucius,</hi> that poſſeſſed a part of the Iland in the time of <hi>Marcus Aurelius:</hi> who, queſtionleſſe had commerce with
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:11466:70"/>the Biſhop of Rome, for he had beene at Rome, and held correſpondence with the Emperour: but that he ſhould be ſubiect to the Biſhop of Rome, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him the head of the Vniuerſal Church, admits no manner of proofe. In the yeare of our Lord 530. that Warlike Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> raigned in great Britaine, of whom being a Chriſtian it doth not appeare, that eyther he depended vpon the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of Rome, or that they intermedled in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or inueſting of the Britaine Biſhops, during the raigne of <hi>Arthur,</hi> or his Succeſſors. In the yeare 596. ſoone after that the Engliſh Saxons (being Almaines, and at that time Infidels) had inuaded Britaine, then did <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt ſend <hi>Auſten</hi> into this Iland, a man full of faction, and arrogancy, to plant the Chriſtian faith; although the Chriſtian Religion had beene planted here more then foure hundred yeares before. But by the Chriſtian faith, theſe men doe now vnderſtand the authority of the Pope. This <hi>Auſten</hi> was ſtrongly and ſtoutly oppoſed by the Chriſtians of that Countrey, who refuſed to change their auncient forme of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which they had receiued from ſuch as were Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples to the Apoſtles. They had ſeuen Biſhopricks and one Archbiſhopricke; the ſeat whereof being firſt errected at <hi>Carleon,</hi> was afterward tranſlated to S. <hi>Dauids,</hi> as it is recorded by <hi>Rainulphus Ceſtrenſis, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 52. for the Archbiſhop of London was of a later foundation: beſides they had a Colledge of 2100. religious perſons at Bangor, who about the yeare 550. when the Order of S. <hi>Benet</hi> began to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:11466:70"/>flouriſh in this Ile, were called by the new name of Monkes: Men that adicting themſelues to the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Diuinity, got their liuing by the labour of their handes; not being tyed to the rigorous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of a Vow: whereunto no man by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Order of S. <hi>Benet</hi> is obliged. This <hi>Auſten</hi> then found meanes to inſinuate himſelfe into the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar acquaintance of one of the petty Kings of the Countrey, called <hi>Ethelfred</hi> King of Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, who was an enemy to the auncient Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of that land, and had inuaded their Countrey, and waſted many Churches: with this <hi>Auſten</hi> then he combined againſt the Chriſtians, and both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether maſſacred the poore religious men of Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, and flew no leſſe then 1200. of them: The ſame <hi>Ethelfred</hi> aſſiſted by the petty Engliſh Kings to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite the Chriſtians inhabiting the Countrey, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued the Archiepiſopall ſeate from London, and tranſlated it to Canterbury, where ordinarily he made his reſidence. Now the principall difference betweene the Chriſtians and the Romiſh faction was about the day of Eaſter, the ſingle life of Prieſts, and the Church-muſique proceſſions and Letany after the order of Rome: conſider further that ſome of the people were Pelagians, for there was no ſpeech then of tranſubſtantiation, nor of the Popes grand Pardons and indulgences, nor of the Sacrament vnder one kinde, nor of ſuch here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies as were hatched in the after ages: Whereof we haue ſundry witneſſes, as <hi>Amandus Zirixenſis</hi> in his his Chronicle. <hi>Beda</hi> in the ſecond booke of his

                  <p>But becauſe it may be preſumed, that the Queene his mother being of the Church of Rome, might haue giuen him ſome impreſſions of that Religion, his Maieſty therefore meeteth therewith, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, that ſhe adhaered not to the groſſer ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Poperie; and that in the chriſtening of the King her ſonne, ſhe charged the Archbiſhop that baptized him, not to vſe any ſpittle in the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nies, ſaying, that ſhee would not haue a rotten and pocky Prieſt to ſpit in her childes mouth; that at her entreaty the late Queene ELIZABETH, who was an enemy of Popery, was his God-mother, and chriſtened him by her Ambaſſadour; that ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vrged him by any letters to adhaere to Popery; that euen her laſt words befor her death, were, that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:11466:72"/>howbeit ſhe were of a diuers Religion, yet ſhee would not preſſe him to change the Religion he profeſſed, vnleſſe he found himſelfe moued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto in his conſcience: that if he ledde an honeſt, and a holy life, if he did carefully adminiſter iuſtice, and did wiſely and religiouſly gouerne the people committed to his care, ſhe made then no queſtion, but he might, and ought to perſeuere in his owne Religion. By theſe Demonſtrations doth his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty of England prooue, that this great Princeſſe had no ſiniſter opinion of our religion.</p>

Which is as much to ſay, that although that which the King ſayes be falſe, yet to doe him a pleaſure, he will beleeue it, and ſo giues him the lye very mannerly; as if he ſhould ſpit in his face, doing him reuerence: like the Iewes that cryed all haile to our Sauiour, when they buffeted him: His Encounter ſhould haue had ſome coulerable matter at the leaſt: for what can argue more weakeneſſe in him, then to mention letters that no man euer ſaw? Or what ſtrength hath it to weaken the teſtimony of a King concerning his own mother? For to whom ſhould ſhe haue opened her minde more familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then to her ſonne? Or what wordes are more ſerious, or more vndiſſemblingly ſpoken, then ſuch as are the laſt that dying perſons doe vtter? For

                  <p>Here <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> begins to put himſelfe into the field,<note place="margin">In expoſit. Symb.</note> we expected him long agoe.

                  <list>
                     <item>1.

                     <item>4.

                     <hi>Balſamon,</hi> and you ſhall finde that which I ſay to be true But <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> being content to write, as Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters breake their Faſt, that is, tumultuarily and in haſt, hath not had this curioſity.</p>
                  <p>It remaineth to examine the place of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> of which euery one that hath a quicke ſmell, will acknowledge the corruption and falſification: Firſt of all, becauſe it is not credible that this holy Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage would oppoſe himſelfe ſingle to the whole Church of his time, and to all the Doctors that went before him, and namely to the Councell of Carthage, whereat himſelfe had beene a preſent aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant. Secondly, becauſe it is not credible that S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> would contradict himſelfe: for in the ſixe and thirty Chapter of the eighteenth booke of the Citie of God, he ſpeaketh thus: <hi>The ſupputation of theſe times (ſince the building vp of the Temple) is not found in the holy Scriptures, which are called Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, but in other bookes, among which are the Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees.</hi> Is it poſſible to ſay in more plain and expreſſe termes, that the <hi>Maccabees</hi> are not holy Scriptures nor Canonicall bookes? But heere wee admire a pretty pleaſant folly and ſtupidity of a taile hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely faſtened and ſowed on by ſome Monke: for after all this, they make S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to adde, <hi>Which bookes not the Iewes, but the Church boldeth for Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall</hi> O groſſe Impoſture! After that hee had ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſet downe that the <hi>Maccabees</hi> are not holy nor Canonicall Scriptures, would hee ſay that the Church receiueth them for Canonicall? By the ſame fraude, this other place of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> which <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effeteau</hi>
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:11466:83"/>alleadgeth, hath beene falſified. Let vs adde hereunto that S. <hi>Auſtin, cap.</hi> 23. of his ſecond booke againſt <hi>Gaudentius,</hi> anſwereth thus vnto <hi>Gauden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> who ſerued himſelfe with the example of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zis,</hi> who killed himſelfe, whereof mention is made in the ſecond booke of the <hi>Maccabees. The Iewes do not hold this booke in the ſame rancke with the law, the Prophets, and the Pſalmes to which Ieſus Chriſt beareth witneſſe, is they that beare record of him. But this booke is receiued by the Church, not vnprofitably, if men read it ſoberly: principally becauſe of the ſufferings of certaine Martyrs.</hi> Who feeth not that he doth wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the authority of theſe bookes, in that Ieſus Chriſt doth giue no teſtimony vnto them? And if theſe bookes haue not beene reckoned for holy Scripture, amongſt the faithfull of the olde Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I maruell when they became holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
                  <p>It is alſo a poynt very conſiderable, that in this place of S. <hi>Austin</hi> produced by <hi>Coeffeteau, Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticus</hi> is put among the Canonicall bookes; in which booke it is ſaid, <hi>cap.</hi> 46. <hi>Samuel</hi> propheſied af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, and declared vnto King <hi>Saul</hi> his death, lifting vp his voyce out of earth.

He ſaith that the Church of Smyrna did ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the feaſt of the Martyrdome of Polycarp. That <hi>Baſil</hi> did recommend the Feaſts of S. <hi>Iulitta,</hi> and of the forty Martyrs. That <hi>Gregory Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zene</hi> did ſolemnize with the other Chriſtians the Feaſt of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and S. <hi>Gregory</hi> of Niſſa that of the Martyr <hi>Theodore:</hi> That <hi>Cyprian</hi> commanded that they ſhould marke out the dayes of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Martyrs, to the end that they migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celebrate their memories. That S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth booke againſt <hi>Fauſtus Manicheus, cap.</hi> 21. ſaith that the Chriſtian people did celebrate the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories of the Martyrs: And yet that S. <hi>Polycarpe, S. Iulitta,</hi> &amp;c. are no Saints, of whom there is any
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:11466:84"/>mention in the Scripture. Hee addeth notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the Church of England is in that, leſſe irreligious then the Caluiniſts of Fraunce, who haue cut off all ſorts of holy-daies of Saints, aſwell Apoſtles as others. As touching the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends, We are, ſaith hee, no more credulous of them then you. He ſaith he doth not receiue mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, vnleſſe they be approued by the publique teſtimony of the Church: and that euen in the firſt ages they ſuggeſted and foyſted in, falſe actes of Martyrs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe paſſages which he alleadgeth are in part falſe, partly they are of no vſe to proue the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Let vs begin with the falſhood.</p>
                  <p>Firſt in alleadging out of <hi>Euſebius</hi> the example of the Church of Smyrna, who buried the bones of <hi>Polycarpe</hi> with honour, and celebrated his memory Anniuerſarily euery yeare, there is no mention made of his Feaſt or Holy-day, but onely of a day dedicated to the commemoration of his Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;<note place="margin">Ignorantes nos Chriſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nunquam relinquere, qui pro totius ſeruan dorum mundi ſalute paſſus eſt, nec alium quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam colere poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe. Nam hunc quidem tanqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> filium Dei ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus, Martyres verò tanquam diſcipulos &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitatores Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni diligimus.</note> which thing was done without any preciſe neceſſity of making it holy-day.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he doth malitiouſly diſſemble the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent words which goe before, where the Church of Smyrnaſpeaketh in this manner: <hi>They are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that we neuer leaue Chriſt, who died for the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them of the world, who are to be ſaued, and that we can yeelde ſeruice to none other but to him: For him we adore as the ſonne of God, but we loue the Martyrs as his Diſciples and imitators.</hi> Wordes which ſhew to what end, and in what manner the Smyrnians ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured the memory of <hi>Polycarpe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:11466:85"/>
                  <p>So is it alſo falfe that <hi>S. Baſill</hi> recommendeth the Feaſts of <hi>S. Iulitta</hi> and the forty Martyrs, for in thoſe two Homilies there is no ſpeech at all of Feaſts.</p>
                  <p>But the falfeſt peece that hee produceth is the Oration of <hi>Gregory Nyſſene</hi> in praiſe of the Martyr <hi>Theodore,</hi> which was ridiculouſly framed by ſome Greeke Monke, in the time that the Scythians, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe called the Huns and Tartars ouer-ran Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia, Cappadocia, and Armenia; which In Rhodes began in the yeare 520 as both <hi>Cedrenus</hi> and <hi>Zona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> teach.<note place="margin">Cedrenus in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtaſio, Ann. <hi>23.</hi>

                        </gap>.</note> For about the ende of this Oration the Authour entreateth this Martyr to defend his Countrey againſt he incurſions of the Scythians: of which there was neuer word ſpoken in the time of <hi>Gregory Nyſſene:</hi> for they fell out about one hundred and twenty yeares after. The whole ſtory alſo of this Martyr is euedently fabulous. The Authour ſaith that he was of <hi>Iobs</hi> Country, and conſequently an Arabian, whereas <hi>Theodorus</hi> is a Greeke name. Within a little while after, contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting himſelfe, he ſaith that he ſuffered at Amaſia, a Cittie of Cappadocia, and that the place of his death was alſo his Countrey. He ſaith that he was a Souldier in the Romane bandes: But at that time (to wit, vnder <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximinian</hi>) the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes did not entertaine the Arabians in ſeruice. Moreouer the Story of his Martyrdome is plainely fabulous. Being interrogated and examined by his Paynim Iudges, with all gentleneſſe and mildenes, he anſwered at the firſt day with iniurious ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, comparing the Godddeſſe whom they ſerued
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:11466:85"/>to an hare, or to a ſow. All this notwithſtanding the Iudges ſent him away, and gaue him time to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke himſelfe aduiſedly; he in ſtead of retracting any thing, ſet fire on the great Temple of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Gods: and being called for, againe by the Iudges, confeſſed the fact: thereupon the Iudges flatter him euen ſo far, as to promiſe to this ſimple ſouldier (which was a ridiculous thing) to make him Biſhoppe. But this <hi>Theodore</hi> burſt out a laughing for a long time together, mocking for that the Emperours tooke vpon them the title and purple of Biſhops. The Angels ſinge melodiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him in priſon, and lighten all the Towne ouer with Torches. But he that knoweth how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Diocleſian</hi> they burnt whole Chriſtian Townes without any forme of proceſſe; and that this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter made a butchery, a ſlaughter and channell-houſe of the whole Empire, will acknowledge the falſhood of this Story, which hath beene forged by ſome worſhipper of Images and Reliques about the time of the ſecond Councell of Nice.</p>
                  <p>I put not in among his falſifications, that <hi>Coeffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau</hi> hath put in the margent the eighteenth Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Nazianzene</hi> for the fifteenth: hee that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth his Allegations, and writeth vpon truſt, is eaſily deceiued.</p>
                  <p>Now to his falſhoods let vs adde the vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of his impertinent quotations, which ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe not touch the Queſtion: For if the Church of Smyrna did celebrate the feaſt of <hi>Polycarpe,</hi> or the Church of Caeſaria that of S. <hi>Iulitta:</hi> what is
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:11466:86"/>that to England, who did no more then, then now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adayes it doth celebrate thoſe Feaſts, no more then doe the Churches of Spaine or of Fraunce? And why ſhould England be more bound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto now at this day?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to what purpoſe is it, to ſpeake of the Feaſts of the auncient Chriſtians, and of the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Martyrs; to eſtabliſh the Feaſts of the Church of Rome, which are cleane different, and haue no community with them.

                     <item>2 The commemoration of the Martyrs was done in times paſt, in euery Church according to the ordinance and appointment of the Biſhoppes and Paſtors of the place, without attending the

                     <item>3 Then this ſolemnity carried with it an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſary commemoration, but did not bring with it any neceſſity of keeping Holy-day; whereas now-adayes there be many Saints Feaſts which they keepe Holy-day with more ſcruple, and are celebrated with more ſolemnity, then the Sunday it ſelfe.</item>
                     <item>4 Againe, then theſe dayes of commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Martyrs were few in number, in ſtead that now there is ſcarcely any day in the Calender which doth not carry the name of ſome Saint. And there is ſuch a number of Feaſts to be kept holy, that many poore people crie out, they are famiſhed. They make them deuout whether they will or noe, for they be kept and hindered by this ſuperſtition from working to get bread for their children, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their handes bound with a ſcrupulous ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and a forced idleneſſe.</item>

                     <item>6 Then they ſung no Maſſes in honour of the Saint, whoſe Feaſt they celebrated. And theſe Maſſes carry now a dayes the name of the Saint. There is the Maſſe of <hi>S.

                     <item>7 Then they did not diuerſifie the furniture and preparation for their Maſſes, in ſinging great or leſſer Maſſes according, to the greatneſſe of the Feaſt.

                     <item>8 Alſo in thoſe times, men knew not what it was to ground Feaſts vpon an Alluſion of Silla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.

                  </list>
                  <p>If a man demaund whence commeth this great multitude of Feaſts? I ſay that auarice hath hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched them, and that ambition hath bred them vp: for the more Feſtiuall holy-dayes that there be, the more often men goe to the offering, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons are more frequent: when artiſans and tradſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhut vp their ſhoppes, then the Prieſts open theirs. The Prelates alſo are herein much honored, for it is a great honour to theſe great Maſters, that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:11466:88"/>at their commaundement the trafficke ceaſeth, the ſhops are ſhut vp: the Seſſions of the Iuſtices and of the Priuy Councell are by them broken vp. And therefore when they are among themſelues, they gaude and mocke at the ſimplicity of the people. For indeede they liue vpon their blindenes.</p>
                  <p>Let them then ſet vp the auncient ſimplicity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; let them reſtore to the Churches the liberty of gouerning themſelues heerein according to the exigence of the time and place, and we will not condemne their Feaſts. For indeede we doe not condemne this celebration of the memory of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs and of Saints. We like well the cuſtome of the Engliſh Churches, who haue certaine dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and applyed to the commemoration of the Apoſtles: for they are done without impoſing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of keeping ſtrict Holy-dayes, and without opinion of merite, without commandement of the Pope, and without condemning the French Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, who hitherto haue feared to aſſigne any Feaſts to any man, becauſe that liuing in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where ſuperſtitions doe ſwarme, their people would eaſily be drawne into abuſe, and attainted with that running and ouer-ſpreading contagion which is to attribute that to the creature, which belongeth to the Creator: Meane while we let not to celebrate in our Churches the memory of the Saints and Martyrs, but without any ſet day. And we hold this rule for inuariable, that God hauing ſaid in his law, in expreſſe termes: <hi>Sixe dayes ſhalt thou labour,</hi> he oppoſeth himſelfe againſt God, who
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:11466:88"/>ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not worke ſixe dayes, but thou ſhalt keepe holy thoſe Feaſts on the weeke dayes which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund thee.</hi> Now if in the old Teſtament there be found any ſolemnities or Feaſts, beſides the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both day, they are very few in number, and orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God himſelfe, who as he can giue the rules, ſo alſo can he giue the exceptions: Or if there be any feaſt found, that was inſtituted by men: you ſhall neuer be able to prooue, that it was held vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to trauell vpon that day.</p>
                  <p>There ſhould yet remaine to ſpeake ſomewhat of Legends; but I ſee that <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> is aſhamed of them, and would caſt the blame vpon ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.

And thoſe very miracles of which <hi>Coef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feteau</hi> is aſhamed, are thoſe which we ſee painted on the walles, and in the hangings of the Church: As at Paris in the Cloyſter of S. Geruaſe, an Aſſe worſhippeth and adoreth the Hoſte: neere thereto adioyning, the Bees build a Chappell of waxe, for an Hoſte which they found in the fieldes. In the Temple of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> behinde the Quire, on the left hand, after the miracles of <hi>S. Roche</hi> painted, promiſe is made vnto the people, that they ſhall be healed of the ſwelling of the plague, by adoring his preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body: at <hi>S. Benedict</hi> or <hi>S. Benets</hi> Cloyſter wee ſee the ſaid Saint tumbling himſelfe ſtarke naked amongſt thornes, and ſtopping the dogges with the ſigne of the Croſſe. In the forefront of the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:11466:89"/>Church, called <hi>Des Billettes,</hi> an Hoſte being pricked and ſtabbed by a Iew, bleedeth with great droppes, and being caſt into a ſeething Caldron, became a man in his viſible greatneſſe, that is to ſay, Ieſus Chriſt boyling in a Caldron. An infinite compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of ſuch things are ſo publick, that <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not condemne them, without oppoſing himſelfe to the whole Church of Rome; Fictions that were built vp by the fauour of the night, whiles they put the holy Scripture, the onely light of our ſoules vnder a buſhell. And indeede very lately there haue beene compoſed two great Tomes of the Chronicles of S. <hi>Frauncis,</hi> which challenge all the Legends, and giue place to none of them for lies. Inſomuch that S. <hi>Dominicke, Coeffeteaus</hi> Patron, will henceforward be nothing in compariſon of S. <hi>Frauncis.</hi>

                  <p>We will cloſe vp theſe falſe paſſages with a true one, out of S. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> in his 79. Hereſie, which is the Hereſie of the Collyridians. <hi>Surely the Virgin was a Virgin worthy to be honoured, but yet ſhe was not giuen vs to be adored: for euen ſhe her ſelfe adored him who was borne of her according to the fleſh, but came downe from heauen out of the boſome of the Father. And therefore the Goſpell doth arme vs againſt this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe, telling vs, that the Lord himſelfe ſaid vnto her, What haue I to doe with thee, woman; mine howre is not yet come: To the end that no man ſhould preſume more, then he óught vpon the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>nor ſhould attribute to her too much excellency, he calleth her wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; as it were prophecying of the things that ſhould come to paſſe in the world, by reaſon of Schiſmes and Hereſies, for fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Moſt ſingular is that aboue the reſt which he addeth: <hi>Let</hi> MARY <hi>be had in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but let the Father and the Sonne be adored: Let no man adore</hi> MARY; <hi>I ſay not a woman, but neyther man himſelfe. It is to God that this myſtery is duc. The
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:11466:93"/>Angels themſelues are not capable of ſuch an honour.</hi> And it is worth the noting, that he girdeth at this Title of the Queene of Heauen; and I beſeech the Reader to obſerue it: <hi>Let Ieremy</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>repreſſe thoſe odde houſe-wiues, that they trouble the world no more, and that they may no longer haue this word in their mouthes, We honour the Queene of heauen.</hi> And ſo S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his third booke of the Holy Ghoſt <hi>And for feare</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>leaſt ſome man would deriue this ſame to the Virgin</hi> MARY,<note place="margin">

                  <p>The beſt is, that al this ſeruice of the Virgin, which they call now adayes <hi>Hyperdulia,</hi> and which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vp a good part of the Romane Religion, hath no foundation in the word of God. Onely our Aduerſaries bring in men ſpeaking to this point; but they put their ſpeeches before hand in their mouthes, and make them ſay that which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beleeued. How commeth it to paſſe that Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> who ſerued the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> as a ſonne after the death of Ieſus Chriſt, and the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, who loued and honoured her, had yet neuer recourſe to her interceſſion: they might haue ſaid

                  <p>Hereupon <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> confounding the Kings whole diſcouery, he beginneth by a complaint that his Maieſty calleth <hi>Tutelary</hi> and familiar Gods thoſe leſſer Saints, to whom many of the people do vow themſelues in particular, and of whom they ſet the Images vpon their Cupboords or ouer their Chimneyes. But his Maieſty doth not intend to call the Saints familiars nor Tutelarie Gods: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he ſay that in the Church of Rome they call them ſo, onely he meaneth, that the Church of Rome hath ſubſtituted them in place of the Tutela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and domeſticall gods, and that hee doth enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them after the ſame faſhion. For the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims had their tutelarie gods ouer euery town, and ouer euery Countrey. <hi>Iuno</hi> was Lady-gardian of Carthage: <hi>Venus</hi> of Cyprus and of Paphos: <hi>Pallace</hi> of the Countrey of Attica: <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Quirinus</hi> of Rome, &amp;c. ſo the Church of Rome hath Saints that are Patrons of Cities and Countries: Saint <hi>Marke</hi> of Venice: S. <hi>Geneuiefue</hi> of Paris: S. <hi>Iames</hi> of Spain: S. <hi>Dennis</hi> of France, &amp;c. and as the Paynims did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute charges amongſt their gods; ſo in the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:11466:94"/>Church of Rome euery Saint hath his charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. The hunters did inuocate <hi>Diana,</hi> now adaies they haue recourſe to S. <hi>Euſtace,</hi> S. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> who now is called vpon by the Pilots and Sea-faring men, hath taken the place of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux.</hi> The good Goddeſſe <hi>Lucina</hi> who was aſſiſting to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that trauelled in childe-birth, hath now giuen place to S. <hi>Margaret:</hi> for ſo her Legend ſaith that the Dragon hauing ſwallowed her downe ſhe made the ſigne of the Croſſe in his belly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he burſt aſunder, and ſhe came forth through the breach, which was a kinde of lying in. S. <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> with his huge body, hath ſucceeded <hi>Hercules:</hi> for ſo they make him alſo to carry a clubbe. There wanted yet a Queene of heauen in the place of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> and this holy and glorious Virgin hath beene diſhonoured with ſo prophane a title: yea the very habites and furniture of the gods haue beene tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the Saints. The <hi>Genij</hi> or <hi>Penates</hi> houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold gods had a dogge by their ſide, and ſo hath S. <hi>Roche:</hi> The Image of <hi>Iames</hi> carried a Key, ſo doth that of S. <hi>Peter: Iupiter</hi> a man had hornes on his head, ſuch doe they giue to <hi>Moſes. Iſis</hi> carried a Timbrell, and S. <hi>Gennaſius</hi> a Violin. Thoſe circles which you ſee about the head of the Saints in pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, are thoſe Arches and ſhaddowes wherewith they couered their gods to fence them from the duſt. In like manner are the Officers diſtributed in Paradiſe in a goodly order, and with diuerſity of furniture and prouiſion. For his Holines and the Church of Rome haue taken order for it. We are
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:11466:95"/>aſhamed to produce theſe things, whiles they are not aſhamed to doe them: and we bluſh at that of which they haue no ſhame at all. If we would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long this Diſcourſe, we would eaſily ſhew that a good part of theſe Patrons and Tutelary Saints, are Saints which neuer were, they liue without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing euer beene borne, and are entred into the Church, without euer entring into the world, the painters are wonted to make characters &amp; pictures in a manner ſpeaking, as when they paint Iuſtice with a paire of ballances: Time like an olde man winged: The Fryer like a lame god, becauſe the wood doth ſuſteyne him: ſo the auncients did fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure the faith of a beleeuing man by a woman ſwollowed vp of Sathan, but who did get forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine victoriouſly, and trample the Diuell vnder her feet. And of this Image they haue made their Saint <hi>Margaret:</hi> ſo the Chriſtian was painted as paſſing ouer a violent land-flood, but hauing Ieſus Chriſt with him,<note place="margin">Praeſertim cum ſit manifeſtum in omnem Italiam, Galliam, Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam, &amp; Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam nullum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituiſſe Eccleſias niſi eos quos A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolus Petrus aut ſucceſſores eius conſtitueru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:11466:95"/>doth ſtoutly and ſtiffely maintaine, that there was neuer any Apoſtle in Spaine; and that neyther in Fraunce nor in Affrica, nor in Spaine any planted Church, ſaue they whom S. <hi>Peter</hi> and his ſucceſſors ſent thither. The Story alſo of his life recyted by <hi>Iohn Beleth</hi> and <hi>Iacobus de Voragine</hi> great perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſaith, that he came into Spaine before he was put to death by <hi>Herod, Act.</hi> 12. It muſt needes bee then that he came into Spaine almoſt about the time that Ieſus Chriſt ſuffered: for <hi>S. Iames</hi> ſurui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Chriſt, but a while after his death: His body being put on Ship-boord, went of it ſelfe without Pilot or any guidance into Spaine. Queene <hi>Lupa</hi> raigning then in Spaine: Now it is well knowne, that at that time there was neyther King nor Queene in Spaine; and that it was wholly ſubiect to the Romane Empire. The ſame is to be ſaid of <hi>S. Denis</hi> the Areopagite, whom men ſay to haue plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Goſpell in Fraunce; and hauing ſuffered Martyrdome vnder the Emperour <hi>Domitian</hi> as ſaith <hi>Methodius,</hi> he carried his head betweene his hands from <hi>Mont-Martre,</hi> as farre as <hi>S. Denis,</hi> where he lyeth interred. The reuiuing of learning and good letters hath diſcouered the falſhood of ſuch inuentions. For the moſt auncient Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Hiſtorian that euer was in Fraunce,<note place="margin">Sub Aurelio Antonini filio perſecutio quinta agitata, ac tunc primum inter Gallias martyria viſa, ſerius trans alpes religione tranſgreſſa.</note> is <hi>Sulpitius Seuerus,</hi> who in the ſecond booke of his ſtory ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that there were no Martyrdomes in Fraunce vnder <hi>Domitian</hi> nor a long time after; and that the firſt Martyrdomes which were ſeene in Fraunce, were vnder <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Anthony,</hi>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:11466:96"/>that is to ſay, in the yeare of our Lord 162. three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and fiue yeares after the death of <hi>Domitian:</hi> whoſoeuer ſhall calculate the times, ſhall find that <hi>Denis</hi> the Ariopagite was then Iudge in Ariopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, at the time when <hi>S. Paul</hi> conuerted him: whence it is to be preſumed, that he was at leaſt thirty or fiue and thirty yeare olde: which time if you extend as farre as to the raigne of <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius,</hi> he ſhould haue liued ſome hundred and fiftie yeares: and alſo ſhould die by torment before that he was broken by olde age. We could produce others in this point, but this ſufficeth to iuſtifie the King of great Britaine, who though he ſhould haue called the Saints that neuer were Tutelary gods, yet ſhould there not bee iuſt cauſe to reprehend him.</p>
                  <p>After this <hi>Caeffeteau</hi> comes to the authorities of the Fathers: ſurely this matter ſhould well deſerue ſome commaundement from God: One Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God had cut off al difficulty, and had been more of value then a thouſand teſtimonies of men. But <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> could finde none, for indeede there is none: Being not able then to draw out of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſpring, he ſeekes heere and there for the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternes of men. Our aduerſaries tell vs that they receiue the Fathers for interpreters of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but the paſſages are drawne out of phraſes of the Fathers, in which they doe not interprete the ſcripture: but what will become of the matter if theſe quotations be to no purpoſe, if indeede they be falſe?

                  <p>Aboue all, the place of the Apoſtle, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. is very expreſſe, which his Maieſty of England doth produce, where <hi>S.

It is in this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond kinde, that inuocation of Saints doth decline from Ieſus Chriſt, as we haue ſhewed. As for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing men, whom we employ to pray for vs; this is
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:11466:101"/>nothing like to the inuocation of Saints deceaſed: God willeth that the liuing ſhould pray one for an other, but he hath not commaunded to inuocate the dead: and he who recommendeth himſelfe to the prayers of the liuing, he doth not for all that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them to be ſearchers of the heart: He doth not fall downe on his knees before them; he doth not yeeld them any religious ſeruice: he doth not bring them offerings, nor light candles before them: hee doth not pray vnto God for ſaluation through their merites. In a word, there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon betweene them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> addeth, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> condemneth onely ſuperſtition, which adoreth Angels in the quality of leſſer gods. This is a meere ſhift and an euident tergiuerſation, and which S. <hi>Paul</hi> had already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented in the ſame place, in ſaying that this is done by humbleneſſe of minde, and voluntary deuotion. Now to acknowledge the Angels for Gods, is not for a man to humble himſelfe, but to exalt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: Humiliation is rather in him, who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging them no other then ſeruants and meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of God, doth neuertheleſſe humble himſelfe beneath them by voluntary deuotion. And wee neede here no more vpon this matter then <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,</hi> whom <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> alleadgeth in his margent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelfe, whoſe words are theſe in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries vpon <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. <hi>They who defended the law, induced men alſo to ſerue Angels, ſaying, the lawe was giuen by their interuention.

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:11466:108"/>for the redemption of ſoules, where Chriſt is really ſacrificed; which we ſhall ſee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:11466:109"/>he read it; for had he read it, he would haue found the contrary; he ſhould haue ſeene that the blood which the High Prieſt alone caried into the <hi>Sanctum Sanctoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> was the blood of a beaſt already ſacrificed in the Court, vpon the altar of burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, in the preſence of the people; and there was no ſacrifice more publique, or more ſolemnly performed. Is there any ſuch a nouice in the ſacred Hiſtory, that euer thought that <hi>Aaron</hi> did ſacrifice or offer any beaſt within the place that was moſt holy? It was then a ſprinkling of bloud which he made vpon the Arke, as the concluſion of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ſacrifice, and was no ſacrifice done in priuate.

                     <p>Whereunto I anſwere, that both the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Argumunt are falſe; yea the ſecond is contrary to the Church of Rome. It is falſe that the ſhedding of blood for the remiſſion of ſinnes is a ſacrifice, vnleſſe this blood be offered vnto God for an Oblation, and with the death of the Sacrifice the blood whereof is ſhed. Now here you ſee not, that Ieſus Chriſt did offer any thing vnto God, nor that he ſuffered death in the Euchariſt. The ſecond propoſition is alſo falſe; for it is true that Chriſt ſaith in this Sacrament, that his blood is ſhed, but ſaith not that it is ſhed in this Sacrament He ſpeaks of the effuſion of his blood vpon the Croſſe, which he was to doe immediately after: for Chriſt doth often ſpeake of his death approaching, as if it were at hand; as in the tenth of <hi>Iohn, ver.</hi> 17. <hi>I lay downe my life, that I may take it vp againe.</hi> And a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>I giue downe my life for my ſheepe.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:11466:114"/>of blood ſo diſagreeable: and beſide the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Maſſe, and the Romane Bible ſhould have idly tranſlated the preſent tenſe by the future, if it might, and ſhould bee taken in the preſent tenſe.</p>
                     <p>And this is the place where the perplexity of the errour appeareth, which hew and interferre, that it ſelfe is not vnderſtood: for our aduerſaries ſay, that vnder the formes the blood of Chriſt is ſhed, but yet runnes not out of his veynes: that it is ſhed and yet ſtirres not: and howbeit euery ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion be a motion, yet it is an effuſion without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.

                     <p n="1">1 Firſt the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, and that of the Croſſe cannot be one ſacrifice, becauſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of one agreeth not with the other: for the ſacrifice of the Croſſe, is the death of Ieſus Chriſt offered vpon the Croſſe for our redemption: but the Maſſe is not the death of Ieſus Chriſt, &amp;c. and then is not the Maſſe the ſacrifice of the Croſſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The proprieties and circumſtances differ: the ſacrifice of the Croſſe was painfull, this of the Maſſe is without paine: the ſacrifice of the Croſſe was bloudy, this is not bloudy: one was viſible, the other is inuiſible, and none doth ſee Chriſt, who they ſay is offered: the one hath beene offered, and is not reiterable, for Chriſt died but once: the other is infinitely reiterated, and in infinite places at one time: that was immediately performed by Chriſt, and this is done by the miniſtery of a Prieſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 So doe they alſo much differ in vertue and efficacy; for the death of Chriſt which he once ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:11466:115"/>was ſufficient to redeeme the whole world from eternall damnation: but the Sacrifice of the Maſſe is prized at a very low rate, for there muſt be a greate number of them to redeeme one poore ſoule out of Purgatory: they are ſold in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey for ſixe blanckes, but at Paris they coſt more.

                     <p n="4">4 To be ſhort, ſeeing the ſacrifice of the Croſſe is nothing but the death of Ieſus Chriſt, no man will beleeue, that the Maſſe wherein Chriſt dyeth not, is the ſame ſacrifice with his death.</p>

If then Maſſes doe differ in number among themſelues, why ſhall they not differ in number from the death of Chriſt?

Our aduerſaries ſay, that the ſacrifice of the Croſſe, and the ſacrifice of the Maſſe are one ſacrifice, and that the ſacrifice of the Croſſe is re-iterated in the Maſſe; but the truth is ſo ſtrong, and the euidence thereof ſo plaine to the contrary, that oftentimes it ſlips from them, and they giue ſentence againſt themſelues: For the Councell of Trent, <hi>Seſ.</hi> 22. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. ſaith, that Chriſt hath left vnto his Church a ſacrifice, by which the bloudy ſacrifice which he was to make vpon the Croſſe was repreſented, and the memory thereof perpetuated. The ſame Councell addeth, that the ſacrifice of the Croſſe, and the vertue thereof is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed vnto vs by this ſacrifice. And this doe we beleeue, and many of ours haue beene burned for ſo ſaying. And indeed if the Euchariſt be the commemoration and application of the Sacrifice

Firſt, for the commemoration of a thing is not the thing it ſelfe: the commemoration of a battell is not a battell: the commemoration of a ſacrifice is not the ſame ſacrifice: Secondly, In like manner, the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a thing is not the thing it ſelfe; the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a faſhion is not the faſhion, the application of a Plaiſter is not the Playſter, the application of the propitiatory ſacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt, is not the propitiatory ſacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Thidly, Which is moſt true in matter of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (for the Sacrifice of Chriſt is the payment &amp; ranſome for our ſoules) being cleare that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of a payment is not the payment: to remember a payment, it needes not to begin it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; and the Prieſt doth but mocke with God, if he thinke eyther to pay him, or redeeme vs by a commemoration: Fourthly, if the ſacrifice propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory of Ieſus Chriſt be applyed in the Maſſe, then certainly it is not re-iterated, for a thing is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated by the application thereof: a medicine is not re-iterated by applying it: to re-iterate a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or a ſacrifice to apply it, this needes purgation more then refutation.</p>
                     <p>Let them learne then to ſpeake things in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity: for they muſt of neceſſity eyther ſay that the Maſſe is neyther application nor commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacrifice of the Croſſe: or if in that point they be vnremoueable, let them confeſſe that it is
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:11466:120"/>not the Sacrifice of Chriſt, nor a ſacrifice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory: Fiftly and finally, if they will needes haue that the death of Chriſt is applied vnto vs by ſacrificing, they muſt ſhew out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that God will haue it ſo applyed: We finde in the Scripture that Ieſus Chriſt is applyed vnto vs and that wee haue communion with him by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,<note place="margin">

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:11466:120"/>the hoſt, it is not onely not of the eſſence of the ſacrifice, but alſo it cannot be an action neceſſarily in the ſacrifice: 1. for if by chaunce the Prieſt let fall the whole hoſt into the Chalice, he ſwallows downe both the hoſte and wine together, without any breaking of it; and yet ſuch a Maſſe looſeth not the name of a ſacrifice: 2. Beſides, if the breaking were an action of the Sacrifice, it ſhould follow, that that which were broken in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, were ſacrificed. Now the holy Scripture teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, that Chriſt Ieſus brake bread, and then ſhould Chriſt haue ſacrificed bread; and the bread ſhould be the price of our redemption; which is a groſſe impiety. Now that Ieſus Chriſt did breake bread, the Euangeliſts doe tell vs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26. <hi>Ieſus tooke bread, and brake it.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>S. Paul</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>The bread which we breake;</hi> And the whole Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7. <hi>The Diſciples were gathered together to breake bread:</hi> And this doth conformably agree with the Church of Rome, that mayntaineth it to be ſtill bread before the conſecration. And by the text of the Goſpell it is euident that Chriſt brake it, before he ſaid, <hi>This is my body:</hi> Which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Romiſh Prelates haue corrected the Goſpell, and will haue the bread to be broken after the wordes pronounced. For whereas they will haue the breaking to be an action of the Sacrifice, they ſay well, that ſhould they breake the bread af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the words pronounced, as our Sauiour did, they could not ſay that they doe ſacrifice Ieſus Chriſt, and then their ſacrifice propitiatory ſhould bee a
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:11466:121"/>ſacrifice of bread: thirdly, Therefore can they not finde in the inſtitution of the Euchariſt, which is in the Goſpell, this fraction which the Prieſt vſeth after the wordes; which they would haue to be an action of a propitiatory ſacrifice: neyther can they finde in their Maſſe that breaking of bread, which Chriſt vſed. The chiefe point is, that when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire our Maſters to tell vs what it is that the Prieſt breaketh in the Maſſe, they are blancke: for tell me M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Doctors, doth the Prieſt breake bread in the Maſſe? They anſwere no; for it is no more bread when he breakes it. Doth he breake the Lords bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? No neyther; for that is impaſſible, and cannot be broken; it is wholy in euery part, in euery crum of the Hoſte: what then? What is there left for him to breake? They ſay, the accidents of the bread, which ſoone after they call the formes: that is to ſay, the length and breadth of the bread, but not the bread: And as Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third ſayth, and with him the whole Church of Rome,<note place="margin">Innocent. <hi>3.</hi> l. <hi>4.</hi> de Myſterijs Miſſae cap. <hi>11.</hi> Eſt enim hic co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor &amp; ſapor quantitas &amp; qualitas, cum nihil alterutro ſit coloratum aut ſapidum, quantum aut quale.</note> it is of the length, not of the thing that is long: of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, not of the thing coloured. Let vs leaue this monſtrous Philoſophy, and let vs only bring their doctrine to the ſcale: They ſaid that which was broken in the Maſſe is ſacrificed. Now the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, colours, and dimenſions of bread, without bread are broken in the Maſſe, and conſequently, theſe accidents are ſacrificed and offered for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. O ſpirite of ſlumber that runnes head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into impiety! And here obſerue the fruite of theſe ſubtilities: fiftly, for to ſay that Chriſts body
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:11466:121"/>is broken vnder the accidents, and yet continues whole, is all one as to ſay, that it is broken, and not broken. Againe, we doe not aske of them vnder what it is broken, but onely whether or no it bee broken: for that which is broken vnder another thing, is broken neuertheleſſe: ſixtly, Which error of theirs is new in the phraſe of Scripture, wherein the breaking of bread, is not an action of ſacrifice, but a ſigne of charity, and pledge of vnity. See <hi>Eſay</hi> 58.7. <hi>Lament.</hi> 4.14. Yea, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth expreſly tell vs, that this is the end of breaking bread in the Sacrament, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. <hi>The bread which we breake, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt? inaſmuch as we which are many, are one bread and one body: for we are all partakers of one bread.</hi> It was alſo the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our Sauiour, at his ordinary times of meate, to begin with bleſſing and breaking of bread, <hi>Mar.</hi> 6.41. <hi>Luc.</hi> 24.30.31.

But Chriſt Ieſus inſtituted the Supper for a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall of himſelfe, and to ſhew forth his death till

                     <p>But this is ſufficient for ſouldiers that forſake the fielde: for <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and his aſſociates lighting vpon this ſubiect, they wander in large impertinent queſtions, which make nothing to the point in controuerſie: they winde vp long Diſcourſes, to proue that the death of Ieſus Chriſt is a ſacrifice; a point denyed not by any, &amp; that the Euchariſt is a ſacrifice, which is true; but it is a ſacrifice Euchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, that is to ſay, a giuing of thankes, and as it is called in the Maſſe, <hi>Sacrificium laudis, a Sacrifice of praiſe.</hi> Againe they bring the ſacrifice of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech,</hi> and the figure of the Paſſeouer, and the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the law, which (they ſay) prefigured the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the new Teſtament: with diuers places of the Prophets, eſpecially that of <hi>Malachy,</hi> which foretell the ſacrifice of the New Teſtament, with many ſuch like things, wherein howbeit they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the truth, yet doe they not helpe themſelues thereby, becauſe it is all beſide the purpoſe, and comes not neere the point that is controuerted: for although the Maſſe were the ſacrifice of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech,</hi>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t this, that in the Chriſtian Religion they ſaw neither Altars, nor ſacrifices, nor Images, without which they thought there was no Religion: whence the olde prouerbe comes, <hi>Vnto the Altars;</hi> that is to ſay, as farre as Religion and conſcience: excluſiuely, as if there were no religion without an Altar. <hi>Celſus</hi> the Pagan reproacheth Chriſtians <hi>That they haue neyther Altars, nor Images nor Temples.</hi> In the eighth booke of <hi>Origen</hi> againſt <hi>Celſus:</hi> and in the Dialogue of <hi>Minutius Faelix, Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius</hi> the Pagan ſpeakes thus: <hi>Whence comes it, that the Chriſtians haue no Altars, nor Temples, nor Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to be ſeene?</hi> And in the beginning of the ſeuenth booke of <hi>Arnobius,</hi> the Heathen ſpeake thus vnto the Chriſtians; <hi>Doe you thinke then that there are no Sacrifices to be made?</hi> Whereunto the Chriſtians make anſwere, <hi>Not any.</hi> To be then without Altars
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:11466:125"/>and Sacrifices did offend the Heathen, and made Chriſtianity odious.</p>
                     <p>This is then the reaſon why they ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily vſed theſe wordes of the Table of the Lord, and the holy ſupper and the Euchariſt, whereof there are infinite examples: And yet to remoue offence, and allure the Heathen by little and little, they vſed to call the Table an Altar, and the holy Sacrament by the name of a ſacrifice. And this was diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on grounded on reaſon: for ſeeing the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth call our prayers, and almes, and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſeruice by the name of Sacrifices,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.18.</note> they haue for the ſame reaſon called the holy Supper a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; wherein we doe not onely offer our ſelues vnto God, but doe alſo offer Chriſt Ieſus vnto him, that is, we doe beſeech God to accept the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifice of his death, for our redemption. And this ſerued to draw the Iewes, for whoſe farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, the Deacons were called Leuites, and the day of the reſurrection of Chriſt was called the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. But that which did eſpecially confirme this word Sacrifice, was the cuſtome of the faithfull, which was before the holy Supper, to bring vnto the Table offerings of bread, and wine, and fruites, whereof ſuch a portion was ſet aſide; as might ſerue for the whole aſſembly to communicate in the two kindes, and the reſt was for the poore: which gifts, and offerings and almes in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, yea and ſometimes in the new,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.18.</note> are called ſacrifices and oblations. Yet whereas they doe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily call the Sacrament, the Euchariſt, and the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:11466:126"/>Sacrifice of the Euchariſt, that is to ſay, a giuing of thankes, they giue ſufficient teſtimony, that they meant not to make a ſacrifice propitiatory, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to ſacrifice Chriſt Ieſus for our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Now that the Almes, Gifts and Offerings of the faithfull were called ſacrifices and oblations, none can be ignorant, that is any whit verſed in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

                     <p>The Paſtor of the Church hauing before him vpon the Table all the preſents in great quantity, made prayer vnto God to accept thoſe Giftes, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents and immaculate Sacrifices: that he would accept them as ſometimes he did the ſacrifices of <hi>Abel</hi> and of <hi>Abraham;</hi> that the Angels might carry
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:11466:126"/>them into heauen before God: giftes created by God, bleſſed and ſanctified for euer by Ieſus Chriſt, &amp;c. Wordes which continue to this day in the Canon of the Maſſe, and which were good and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they were ſaid ouer the Almes and Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the people. But which are now become ridiculous, and vngodly, foraſmuch as the Prieſt doth ſay them vpon an Hoſt, which he thinketh to be Ieſus Chriſt: for to call Ieſus Chriſt by the name of gifts and offerings, is to ſpeake againſt the common ſenſe. To pray, that God would accept this ſacrifice, as well as that of <hi>Abel,</hi> is to make the ſacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt no better then the ſacrifice of a beaſt. To pray that the Angels may carry Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and preſent him vnto God, is not to know, that Ieſus Chriſt doth not employ any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be preſented vnto his Father: to call Chriſt by the name of <hi>good things,</hi> yea of things which God createth, and doth alwayes bleſſe and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; this is to mocke Ieſus Chriſt, who cannot bee called by the name of <hi>good things,</hi> that God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not, nor alwaies ſanctifieth: And yet to offer theſe things by Ieſus Chriſt, that is to ſay, to offer Chriſt by Chriſt, is to be vtterly voyde of all ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>Now to know what the Fathers beleeued in this point, we muſt ſearch the places, where they doe expreſly ſpeake thereof.

But in this Sacrifice (of the Euchariſt) there is a giuing of thankes and a comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of the fleſh of Chriſt, which he hath offered for vs, and of the blood which the ſame God hath ſhed for vs.</hi> Obſerue that he ſaith, that this is a ſacrifice of bread and wine, therefore not a ſacrifice, where the fleſh of Chriſt is really ſacrificed. Aboue all, this word of <hi>Wine</hi> is full of force: for the bloud of the Lord was neuer called Wine: Againe, he ſaith that it is a ſacrifice of thankeſgiuing, and of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration: but not of propitiation, or redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</p>
                     <p>The ſame Father in the three and twentieth E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to <hi>Boniface,</hi> ſaith, <hi>When Eaſter approacheth, we ſay thus, to morrow, or after is the paſsion of the Lord: howbeit he ſuffered ſo many yeares ſince, and that this paſsion was but once: indeede vpon the Saboath we ſay to day the Lord roſe againe, although ſo many yeares be paſt ſince the reſurrection. Why is there no body ſo vaine, is to reproue vs for lying, when we ſpeake thus? But becauſe we name thoſe dayes according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance which they haue with the daies, wherin theſe things were done? ſo that this day is called the ſame day, which is not the ſame, but reſembling the ſame by the reuolution of time? Was not Chriſt once ſacrificed by himſelfe? and yet is he ſacrificed vnto the people in a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:11466:127"/>ſacred ſigne, not onely at euery ſolemnity of Eaſter, but alſo euery day: neyther doth he lie, who being asked makes anſwere, that he is ſacrificed. For if the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments haue not ſome reſemblance with the things whereof they are Sacraments, they ſhould be no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

That our chiefe Doctors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that this place muſt be vnderſtood of the Sacrament, and yet there is no mention but of one kinde of bread: vnleſſe his Maieſty (ſaith he) who adoreth the ſufficiency of the Scripture, will make a ſupplement of ſomething to be added thereunto. He addeth that Chriſt is wholly and entier vnder euery kinde, and that the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him neuertheleſſe. That the Church by this meanes hath prouided againſt vnreuerent behauiours: and preuented the hereſie of thoſe
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:11466:129"/>that beleeued not that the bloud was together with the body vnder the kinde of bread.

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:11466:130"/>handled heretofore, hee hath heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing alleadged out of Gods word. And indeede the doctrine of ſaluation was neuer ſo prophanely handled: for GOD is become ſuſpected, and his bookes of faith, haue now no credite in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies. This is a great grace which they doe vnto the word of God, if after a Legend of reaſons, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane allegations, at length ſome ſhort ſentence is caſually produced: and not without cauſe: for why then is it not more fauorable to his Holineſſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire? But let vs heare this place.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond of the <hi>Acts, ver.</hi> 42. it is ſaid that the Diſciples continued together in the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, and in the Communion and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of bread. It is not there ſaid that the people participated in the Cup; therefore they commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated onely vnder one kinde of bread.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 This coniecture is too light by a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny graines: and which is more, it makes againſt the Church of Rome, which beleeueth, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors ought neceſſarily to take it in both kindes. Now in this paſſage it is not ſaid that the Paſtors did participate in the Cup, and they are no more mentioned then are the people: therefore ſhould it follow that the Paſtors alſo did not participate in the cup.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 This alſo is a weake kinde of Argumentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſay, that in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts,</hi> there is nothing mentioned beſide breaking of bread, that therfore the Cup was not vſed. If I ſhould ſay, that being inuited by ſuch a one I haue eaten with him,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:11466:130"/>doth it follow, that I haue not drunke, although I ſpake not of it?</p>
                  <p>This errour proceedeth from ignorance of the ſcripture phraſe, which by the breaking of bread, and by eating of bread, doth vſually vnderſtand the whole banquet, and all kinde of ſuſtenance. So <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.54. <hi>Iacob</hi> inuiteth his brethren to eate breade. See <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 37.25. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.2. and ſundry other places.</p>
                  <p>We cannot be accuſed by this manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, to adde vnto the Scripture: the ſufficiencie whereof we defend againſt our aduerſaries. For if in this place there be no mention of the Cup, it ſufficeth that it is ſpoken of in other places. And to ioyne diuers places together, which ſpeake of the ſame thing, is not to adde vnto the Scripture. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it is not credible, that the Apoſtles hauing ſo expreſly receiued this commaundement, to drinke all of the Cup, would infringe the ſame. Againe, when we ſpeake of the ſufficiency of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, our meaning is not that the Scripture recy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ſtory vnto vs, doth ſpecifie all the particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of that which happened. Onely we ſay, that in things which it commandeth vs to beleeue, and doe, it doth ſufficiently inſtruct vs vnto ſaluation. Now to know what is to be beleeued, and done in this ſacrament, we muſt learne it out of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame, and out of the expreſſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 For Ieſus Chriſt inſtituting this ſacrament among his Diſciples, ſaid vnto them, <hi>Drinke ye all of
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:11466:131"/>this:</hi> That is,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> de corpore Chriſti cap. <hi>15.</hi>
                     </note> as ſaith <hi>Paſchaſius, aſwell the Miniſters as the other beleeuers.</hi> They anſwere, that all thoſe to whom our Sauior ſpake were Paſtors, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this commaundement was giuen onely vnto the Paſtors. Which if it be ſo, by the ſame reaſon alſo the Paſtors onely muſt eate of the bread: for if in theſe wordes, <hi>Drinke ye all of this,</hi> Chriſt ſpake to none but to the Paſtors, then certainly in theſe words, <hi>Take, eate,</hi> he ſpeaks alſo vnto the Paſtors: &amp; if this be ſo, let them tel me where is the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement which bindeth the people to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in the bread? For to participate thereof in faith, it muſt be that God hath ſo commanded.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Alſo it is falſe, that the Apoſtles being with Ieſus Chriſt inſtructing them, or adminiſtring the Sacrament vnto them, held the place of Paſtors; for they were as the flocke, aſſiſting him in taking and receiuing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Againe, the words of Chriſt, <hi>Do this,</hi> bound them to doe vnto their flockes, as Ieſus Chriſt did vnto them: and therefore theſe wordes bound them to giue it vnto the people in both kindes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 But we haue moreouer the expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Let a man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>examine himſelfe, and ſo let him eate of this bread, and drinke of this cap.</hi> Doth he not ſpeake to the people of Corinth, and as himſelfe ſaith, <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>To all them that call vpon the name of Ieſus?</hi> Are not all the faithfull commaunded to examine themſelues, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5? Why then to drinke of the Cup alſo, for the Apoſtle ioyneth theſe things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:11466:131"/>Obſerue alſo that he ſaith not, examine your ſelues when you will drinke, as ſome Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters would haue it, but he will haue euery one to trie himſelfe, and being examined, that he drinke of the Cup. He leaues it not at their choyce, to eate without drinking after they haue beene exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. And if this place binde them to eate, then why not to drinke alſo, ſeeing the commaund is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall?</p>
                  <p n="5">5 It may not be omitted, that nothing ſo perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our aduerſaries, as when we ask them, whether in the ſixth of <hi>Iohn,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>If you drinke not my blood, you ſhall haue no life in you,</hi> the Euchariſt be ſpoken of: If it be not ſpoken of, why doe they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge this Chapter to eſtabliſh their tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation? If it be thereſpoken of, why doe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue the people of that life, in taking the Cup from them? Neyther doth it ſerue the turne to ſay, that the people receiue the blood together with the Hoſt, by a concomitancy, for hee that ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues the blood, doth not drinke. Now Chriſt ſaith expreſly, <hi>If you drinke not, &amp;c.</hi> Furthermore he that takes the blood vnder the Hoſt, doth not take it as ſhed for vs, and with the ſacrament of the effuſion of his blood vpon the Croſſe, which is the manner according to which Ieſus Chriſt would haue euery one to participate thereof: by which it falleth alſo to the ground, which certaine Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſay, that Chriſt doth not in this place of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> explane the manner of communicating, but declareth the ſubſtance thereof: for if Chriſt in this
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:11466:132"/>place ſpeake of the Euchariſt, when he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his blood to be drunke, then queſtionleſſe he ſpeakes of the manner of communicating: for to drinke is the manner of receiuing.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Yea it appeareth that the Church of Rome beleeueth not, that this commaundement, <hi>Drinke ye all of this,</hi> is giuen to the Paſtors alone, ſeeing that Princes haue their ſhare alſo in this priuiledge: An euident proofe that this Order was brought in to exalt the Clergie aboue the Layetie, and to make them companions of Kings, and Princes: which is a cunning like that whereby they make Emperors and Kings to be Canons of certaine Cathedrall Churches. And indeede as the Pope by this ſleight hath deſired to aduance the Clergy, ſo hath hee withall conſulted to aduance himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Clergy.

                  <p n="1">1 For if he had wel weighed the wordes of the Goſpell and of the Apoſtles, he ſhould haue found that Ieſus Chriſt tooke bread, and brake it. But the Church of Rome ſaith, that the Prieſt doth not breake bread.</p>

But the Church of Rome doth not beleeue that the bread is the body of Chriſt, but doth thus expound theſe wordes: <hi>This is my body,</hi> that is, <hi>that which is vnder theſe formes, ſhall be tranſubſtantiated into my body.</hi> For it is certaine, that when Ieſus Chriſt ſaid <hi>This is my body,</hi> by the word <hi>This,</hi> he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that which he gaue. Now the Goſpell doth witneſſe that he gaue bread: therefore theſe wordes, <hi>This is my body,</hi> doe ſignifie as much as <hi>This bread is my body.</hi> And ſo all the auncients doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them.

                  <p>Firſt, the Apoſtle ſaith that it is bread. The Church of Rome denieth that it is bread.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he ſaith that we breake bread: on the other ſide, the Church of Rome ſaith, that there is no bread broken.</p>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:11466:140"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, our aduerſaries being demaunded, what that bread is that is broken, they ſay it is the body of Chriſt; and yet the body of Chriſt cannot bee broken.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith, that this bread which wee breake, is the Communion of the body of Chriſt: whence it followeth againſt the Church of Rome, that the bread which is broken, is not the body of Chriſt, for the participation or communicating of meate, is not the meate it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, it by this word <hi>Bread,</hi> we muſt vnderſtand <hi>the body of Chriſt,</hi> as our aduerſaries will haue it, it will follow, not onely that the body of Chriſt is broken in the Sacrament, but alſo that <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſhold haue mocked vs in ſaying, that, <hi>the bodie of Chriſt is the Communion of the body of Chriſt,</hi> words very ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and which our aduerſaries beleeue not.</p>
                  <p>Sixty, The worſt is, that the Church of Rome holdeth, that there is nothing broken in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but the accidents, that is, the roundneſſe, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, taſte, and length of the bread: and ſo ſhee blaſpemeth horribly, making the Apoſtle to ſay, that the breaking of colours, roundneſſe, and taſte of the bread, is the Communion of the body of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 He ſhould haue found alſo 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. that the Apoſtle ſaith thrice that we eate bread: and in the ſecond and the twentieth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> the Apoſtles came together to breake bread: where our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries are enforced to haue recourſe to ſtrange fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and to make (which is contrary to the Order

                  <p>I ſuppoſe alſo, that if <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> had any good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Ieſus Chriſt, he would haue preſumed of him, that being ſouerainly good, he wold not haue taken pleaſure, to deliuer the Inſtitution of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in ambiguous terms: who wil beleeue, that he that is the light of the world ſhould be the cauſe of darkenes? whence commeth it then that our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries bring in a kind of Maſcarado into this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly banquet, when they introduce a douzen of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures &amp; perplexed termes in the words of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution? Figures which we haue handled and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed in his place.<note place="margin">In my Apology for the Lords Supper, ch. 12.</note> And they who cannot endure that the bread ſhould be called the body of Chriſt, becauſe it is the Sacrament of the body of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facium, <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> according as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, that the Sacraments take ordinarily the name of that which they ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; yet themſelues in the wordes following <hi>(which is broken for you)</hi> admit a like figure, ſaying, that it is not the body that is broken, but the accidents and outward ſignes, and that that which agreeth to the ſigne, is attributed to the thing ſignified.</p>
                  <p>VVhoſoeuer ſhall weigh theſe things without paſsion, will not ſuffer himſelfe to be infolded in this groſſe error, which doth greatly abaſe the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our Sauiour, which maketh him to be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp of his enemies: which maketh Ieſus Chriſt to haue drunken his owne fleſh and bones: which ſaith that he may bee eaten of Mice and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:11466:141"/>vermine: which incloſeth him in filthy vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which maketh the Prieſt ſometimes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine that they haue robbed him of his God; which giueth to a Prieſt, be hee neuer ſo vitious, more power then to the Virgine <hi>Mary</hi> and all the Saints and Angels, who being all put together in one, cannot make Ieſus Chriſt, ſeeing that he is al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ready made, and cannot be produced a new, much leſſe in murmuring certaine words ouer the bread. VVhich doth ouerthrow and aboliſh the humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Sauiour, and by conſequent all our faith; giuing him a body without length: a body which being in diuers places farre a part is by conſequent farre ſeparated from it ſelfe: A body without po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition or ſituation of partes, ſeeing that they are all together vnder one onely point, and in euery little crumme of the Hoſt. Yea many contrary bodies, of which one is at the Table with his Diſciples, the other in the ſtomackes of his Diſciples. For the one body is infirme and weake, the other without infirmity: the one ſpreading his handes, the other not able to ſtirre them: the one ſpeaking and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, the other not able to ſpeake or to breath: the one ſweating in the Garden drops of blood, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther newly receiued into the ſtomacks of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, which did neyther ſweat nor ſuffer. Which of theſe two was our Sauiour? If hee bee but one, how is he contrary to himſelfe? For we haue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed elſe where that the Diſtinction of diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects cannot be but when onething is compared to diuers things at one time, as when one and the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:11466:141"/>ſame man is poore and rich, little and great, in compariſon of diuers perſons. But here they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply theſe diuers reſpects to the body of Ieſus Chriſt without comparing him to any other body, nay they oppoſe him to himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>That I may not further ſay, that this doctrine doth annihilate the body of our Lord, by being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued into the ſtomacke: for when the formes are altered in the ſtomacke by the digeſtion, they ſay that the body of the Lord is no longer there, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet is it come forth: it muſt follow then that eyther it is reduced to nothing, or changed into ſomething elſe. Both the one and the other, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like blaſphemous.</p>

                     <q>The Doctor <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> anſwereth. We know no ſuch matter. For we call workes of Supere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation, thoſe which haue for their obiect the Euangelicall Counſels, to the which all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are not bound: as for a man to ſell all his goods, and to giue them to the poore, &amp;c.

But as touching the treaſure of Indulgences, <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> ſaith, that it is compoſed of the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aboundance of the merites of Ieſus Chriſt, and of the Satisfactions of the Saints, who haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered more then they deſerued, as of the holy Virgin, and other Saints. God not permitting that any thing of their ſorrowes or ſufferings ſhould periſh, it being a thing iuſt and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they ſhould ſerue to the communion of the Saints, as members of the ſame body.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In all this not a word of ſcripture, no authority of the Auncients,<note place="margin">The Anſwere.</note> no example of Antiquity: <hi>Coef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feteau</hi> onely telleth vs his opinion. I might ſatisfiè
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:11466:144"/>him with like reaſon, by oppoſing our opinion; but he ſhall not ſo lightly goe away with the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For this is one of the Cankers of the body of the Church of Rome; one of the principal pieces of the myſtery of iniquity.</p>
                  <p>The opinion of the Church of Rome, according as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth repreſent it in the ſeuenth and eight Chapters of his booke of Monkes, is, that there are certaine excellent workes, which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Counſels of perfection, which God doth not command, but doth only counſell; workes which as they are more cumberſome, and vneaſie to be done, ſo alſo being performed, they are more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and more excellent then all that GOD hath commanded in his Law: more then to loue God with all his heart, and his neighbour as himſelfe: Workes to which a man is not bound, and if he do them not, he is not puniſhable, but in obſeruing them he getteth a degree of glory aboue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort. Such are perpetuall Virginity, Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the diſtribution of all his goods to the poore. But eſpecially the vowes of Obedience, of Pouerty and Chaſtitie; which are the three vowes of the Monkes, whoſe expreſſe profeſſion it is to doe workes of Supererogation, by the merite of which they ſhall gaine in Paradiſe an eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of glory aboue the popular Saints, and the Communalty of ſoules.</p>
                  <p>All this being but a ſwolne Bliſter of pride, we will pricke it and abate it with the worde of God. And indeede a man had need read this often ouer,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:11466:145"/>before he ſhall finde any thing reliſhing of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 It is a thing almoſt incredible, that there are any men to be found which thinke themſelues to be more perfect, then God hath commanded. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. dooth giue vs this commandement, <hi>Be you perfect as your father which is in heauen is perfect.</hi> Is there any man that can be more perfect then God? For although no man can euer approach to his perfection, yet will he haue vs to conforme our ſelues to his example. So that amongſt men he ſhall be the moſt perfect, who ſhall moſt frame himſelfe thereunto. Now that this is an expreſſe commandement, and a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on neceſſarily required, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe dooth acknowledge it, <hi>chap.</hi> 13. of Monks: where notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he doth malitiouſly loppe off theſe laſt wordes,<note place="margin">§ Tertio.</note> 
                     <hi>As my father which is in heauen is perfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 With like pride, theſe people will be more perfect then Ieſus Chriſt, whoſe righteouſneſſe in regard of his humanity, conſiſted in nothing elſe then in doing the will of his Father. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>Here I am, O Lord, to doe thy will.</hi> And <hi>Galat.</hi> 4. <hi>He was made ſubiect to the law, to the end that he might redeeme them which were vnder the law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 All the perfection and righteouſneſſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the Angels conſiſteth onely in executing the commaundements of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. <hi>You migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Angels that excell in vertue, you that doe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement in obeying the voyce of his wordes, ye his
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:11466:145"/>ſeruants that doe his pleaſure.</hi> It is not found that they do any works of ſupererogation. And by that reaſon the Angelical perfection ſhould be inferior to the Monaſticall Me thinks that the Capuchins, by calling themſelues Angels, Arch Angels, Spirits, Cherubin or Seraphin Friars, illuminated Fathers, &amp;c. haue done wrong to their worth and dignity, by taking names too baſe for them, and inferiour to their Capuchine perfection.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 I adde that this word of Counſell of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is iniurious againſt the law of God, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it of imperfection; for it is as much to ſay that the law is not a perfect rule of Righteouſneſſe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that man, a weake and ſinfull creature, can ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe it, and doe workes much better then it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth. That wealth is not great which is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted by pouerty: It is but a weake and feeble righteouſneſſe which can be exceeded by ſinners. If beſides the law there haue beene counſels of perfection, what doth thence follow, but that the law of God is a rule of imperfection?</p>
                  <p n="5">5 But let vs heare a little, what are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of God. Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thus: <hi>A new commaundement giue I you, that you loue one another as I haue loued you.</hi> Where is the man ſo much puffed vp with his owne merites that can ſurpaſſe this loue? Or loue his neighbour more then Ieſus Chriſt hath loued vs? He being righteous, hauing giuen his life for ſinners? The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of life for mortall men? The Sonne of God for the ſlaues of the Diuell to make them his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:11466:146"/>yea his friendes, yea his brethren, yea his Spouſe, yea his body, yea one with him? Theſe be depths that cannot be fathomed, but depths of his loue and grace. All the feruor of our charity is but coldneſſe in compariſon of it, how farre then from doing any thing ouer and aboue it?</p>
                  <p n="6">6 God commaundeth in his law <hi>that we ſhould loue him with all our heart, and with all our ſtrength:</hi> He commaundeth all that we can doe; we cannot then doe more then he commaundeth: to ſay that a man can loue God more then he can, is to ſay that he can doe that which hee cannot doe. Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe neuer loued his Father more then with al his ſtrength. And here the truth is ſo ſtrong that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the thirteenth Chapter of his booke of Monkes,<note place="margin">§ Quod autem.</note> after that he had a long time la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored and ſweated therupon, is conſtrained to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect this commaundement of God: affirming, that when God will be loued with All our heart, and with all our ſtrength, by this word ALL we muſt vnderſtand <hi>a part,</hi> as if I ſhould ſay, that the <hi>right</hi> ſide ſignifie h the <hi>left,</hi> or that <hi>white</hi> ſignifieth <hi>blacke.</hi> Though this Prelate made no conſcience to ieſt in this manner in the explication of ſo holy a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and the moſt important of all the worde of God, and ſuch as is an abridgement of the whole law: at leaſt he ſhould haue beene affraid to bring in the diuell into partage with God: for if God be content with one part of our heart, it followeth that a man may giue the other parte to the diuell.</p>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:11466:146"/>
                  <p n="7">7 Adde hereunto the Commandement of the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul, Philip.</hi> 4. <hi>Furthermore Brethren whatſoeuer things are iuſt, whatſoeuer things are pure, whatſoeuer things pertaine to loue, whatſoeuer things are of good report, if there be any vertue, and any praiſe thinke on thoſe things.</hi> I demaund then of theſe. our Maſters, whether the workes of Supererogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be things iuſt, or whether they be vertuous, or things worthy of praiſe: if they be not, we muſt not employ our ſelues about them: if they be iuſt and praiſe-worthy, then are they demaunded by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle.

                  <p>Here might be a fit place to repreſent the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniencies of the Vow of Virginity, and what vices it hath brought into the Couents. Thus at Rome, from whence this ordinance doth come, publique Stews are allowed and eſtabliſhed; which <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> doth maintaine to haue beene wiſely eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and compareth in this point the Pope with God. Adde hereunto that this vow is vndertaken many times without thinking of this matter, and of which they afterwards repent them by leiſure. Many there be that enter into Cloyſters and theſe
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:11466:148"/>vowes out of neceſſity, others out of griefe and diſcontentment: and they beare it accordingly, with impatience. Laſtly, I ſay that in Virginity there are two things required, firſt, incorruption of the body; ſecondly, Chaſtity in affections. The firſt is not a vertue: the ſecond is commanded of God, and therefore is not a worke of Supereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>They adde hereunto Martyrdome, whereunto if a man doe expoſe himſelfe without any neceſſity and doth precipitate himſelfe into it without being called thereunto by God, it is not onely not a work of Supererogation, but a very tranſgreſſion of the commaundement of Ieſus Chriſt, who biddeth vs, that <hi>when they perſecute vs in one Citie, to flie into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi> It is ſufficient for Chriſtian conſtancy to beare the brunt when it commeth vpon vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out running to encounter it: to receiue neceſſary euils and harmes without poſting after them.

And ſhall this then be counted a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, whereunto a man is not bound, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding if we doe not follow, we are perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous againſt God, and prodigall of our owne ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? True it is that many are ſaued without ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Martyrdome. But ſo withall that there is none ſaued vnleſſe that he be prepared for Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: In which there are theſe two things: firſt, the paines and torments of the body: ſecondly, the conſtant perſeuerance in the faith. The bodily griefes and paines are not vertues, and therefore cannot bee workes of Supererogation. But that which is praiſe-worthy in Martyrdome is a firme faith and feruor of zeale, which becommeth a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious Conquer our ouer the flame of the fire. Now this faith and this zeale are commaunded of God, and we are bound to ſtrengthen and fortifie our ſelues thereunto. It is not then an vndue worke, or a worke of Supererogation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and indeede it is a ſubtilty of Sathan to place Martyrdome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vnneceſſary workes, to the end that a man ſhould not hold himſelfe bound thereunto.</p>
                  <p>They further adde the ſale of all our goods, to diſtribute them to the poore: and this is the onely example which <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> doth produce vnto vs,<note place="margin">To ſell all that he hath.</note> which is the weakeſt of all. For ſo farre is it from being a worke of Supererogation, that many times it is not ſo much as a good worke. The wordes of
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:11466:149"/>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> are very expreſſe, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>Though I ſhould giue all my goods to the poore, and haue not loue, it profiteth me nothing.</hi> This is then a worke which may be done without charity, and by hypocriſie. I adde alſo that he that ſhould bee charged with a great number of children ſhould haue a charity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanely vndiſcreet, if he ſhould giue al his goods to the poore: for piety doth not ouerthrow nature. He that hath no care of his family hath denyed the faith, and is worſe then an Infidell:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim</hi> 5.</note> for in ſtead of being charitable, he becommeth voyde of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and naturall affection. A man ſhould haue his purſe open, but not without bottome that will holde nothing: neither ſhould a man giue his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney without reaſon, as if hee were angry with it. We muſt further alſo take heede that our liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be not in the nature of thefts and larcenie, in giuing that to one which is due to another. This diſtribution then is commendable, if it bee done without hypocriſie, without ſuperſtition, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an opinion of making God indebted and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding vnto vs, and ſo that it do not diuert vs from other more neceſſarie works.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things conſidered doe furniſh vs with an inuincible demonſtration againſt this abuſe, which thinketh that for a man to diſtribute all that hee hath to the poore, is a worke more excellent then the fulfilling of the law, that is to ſay, more then to loue God with all his heart, and his neighbour as himſelfe. For the things which are alwayes good, are more valuable then thoſe which are only good<note place="margin">Ariſt. Top. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <pb n="288" facs="tcp:11466:150"/>conditionally, and vpon certaine conſiderations. Now the loue of God and of our neighbour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended vnto vs in the law, is alwayes and in all conſiderations good. But the diſtribution of a mans goods to the poore is only good vpon thoſe conſiderations which I haue before repreſented, and therefore the loue of God and of our neighbor is more of value then it.</p>
                  <p>This reaſon is yet ſtronger: a thing that is good in it ſelfe is alwayes better then that thing which is not good, but in reſpect of another. Now the loue of God &amp; of our neighbor is good in it ſelfe; but the diſtribution of all that wee poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe to the poore, is not good vnleſſe it be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of our loue to God, and to our neighbor, and therefore our loue to God and to our neighbour is better. Yea I ſay that all that is praiſe-worthy in that liberality which giueth all to the poore is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which is commaunded vs in the law, euen ſo farre as to loue God with all our heart, and with all our ſtrength, and to loue others as our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>It is then in vaine, that they alleadge vnto vs the commaundement of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. giuen vnto the young man (who ſaid that hee had kept all the commaundements from his youth) to whom our Sauiour replied, <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, ſell all that thou haſt, and giue it to the poore, and thou ſhalt haue a treaſure in heauen.</hi> For firſt of all our aduerſaries are deceiued in thinking this young man had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the law, ſeeing that he was couetous, as our Sauiour ſheweth, <hi>Marc.</hi> 10 24. where after that this
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:11466:150"/>young man had left Chriſt, with purpoſe rather to keepe his goods then to follow Chriſt, our Sauior ſaid to his Apoſtles, <hi>Children how hard is it for them that truſt in riches to enter into the Kingdome of God?</hi> He that truſteth in his riches and preferreth them before Chriſt, tranſgreſſeth the law, and doth not loue God aboue all things. And indeed <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> in his 64 Homily vpon S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> ſaith that he was couetous. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> vpon that place ſayth, that he came to tempt Chriſt, &amp; in that our Sauior Chriſt loued him, it was a loue of compaſſion, and not an approbation of his Auarice.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luc.</hi> 19.41.</note> So Ieruſalem was full of the blood of the Prophets, and yet our Sauiour wept ouer it, which teares could not bee without ſome loue.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they abuſe themſelues in thinking that this is a counſell giuen to all: for we haue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed that it ſhould be il done oftentimes, to obſerue it. But Chriſt gaue this commaundement particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to this young man to diſcouer his coueteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to ſhew vnto him how farre he was from the accompliſhment of the law; of which hee ſo much boaſted: our Sauior putteth his finger vpon his impoſtume, to make him to feele his Maladie. For Chriſt who knoweth the hearts of men, and the things that are to come, knew well enough that he would not forſake his goods, and that hee was not in diſpoſition to follow him And indeede no man can denie but that this young man was much to blame that he reiected Chriſts counſell, and refuſed to follow him. But according to the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:11466:151"/>doctrine of our aduerſaries, he is not to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended: for (ſay they) it is a counſell of perfection, to which no man is bound. In a word it is ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid there, nor elſe where, that in ſo doing he had done a worke of Supererogation.</p>
                  <p>But it ſeemeth to me that this preſumptuous doctrine is not comely in the mouth of Monkes; who doe not vow pouerty, but rather to be rich. There be many Monkes of great reuenues, who liue like Princes. Others are poore in their owne particular and priuate eſtates, but are rich in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. Their begging and loitering is fatter to them then the peoples labouring, they gather much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney vnder the colour of Pardons. They neuer goe but to the funerals of rich men: they ſing no Maſſe but for them that haue giuen them before hand: they fleece and ſhare euen vpon the graues, and death it ſelfe is made tributary vnto them. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially I finde that their tottering faith, and the profeſsion that they make of doubting of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, doth very ill ſort and agree with theſe works of Supererogation. But to omit for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, this doctrine which preacheth Diſtruſt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Scripture preacheth confidence and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Faith: This doctrine, I ſay, which teacheth vs to pray, <hi>Our Father which art in heauen,</hi> without knowing whether we be the children of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, or no: And which accounteth it arrogant pride for a man to truſt vpon the promiſe of God: To omit this, I ſay, let vs onely conſider, how theſe things can agree; that men ſhould ſeeke by works
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:11466:151"/>of Supererogation to come to a more excellent degree of glory aboue other men, and yet in the meane time to doubt, whether themſelues ſhall be ſaued or eternally damned. Thus they tremble, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hell open vpon them, while their ambition ſtretcheth it ſelfe beyond the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Like vnto a man whoſe ambition a whole Kingdome or Empire will not ſuffice, and yet ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in feare to be hanged the next day. Were it not better to ſticke to the promiſes of God, then to liue in ſuſpenſe betweene the feare of hell, and the hope of an extraordinary glory, ballancing his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite betweene Pride and Deſpaire? Offending God as much through incredulity as through preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? How great then muſt the terrour of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and trembling of heart be in thoſe men, who content themſelues with the bare keeping of Gods commaundements, and alſo of thoſe that ſeeke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe men to borrow Satisfactions, and to buy their Merites.</p>
                  <p>All this that hath formerly beene ſaid, is not ſo to be taken, as though we did abſolutely denie that there are no counſels in the Goſpell: the auncient Fathers doe acknowledge as much with vs. It is a good and a wiſe counſell to abſtaine from things lawfull, as from the vſe of meates, when our weake brother is ſcandalized thereby. It is a wiſe counſell for a Paſtor or Miniſter to take no ſtipend when he can liue otherwiſe, or when it giueth occaſion to the wicked to defame the Goſpel. It is a wiſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell to a man that hath the gift of continency to
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:11466:152"/>abſtaine from marriage, eſpecially in time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution. But that the obſeruing of them ſhould be a perfection aboue the law, or that it ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue a degree of glory in Paradiſe aboue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rancke of Saints, is that which we haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be falſe, and contrary to the Goſpell; and a doctrine that lifteth a man vp on high, to precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him with a greater downe fall.</p>

                     <p n="1">
                        <note place="margin">The cheefe part of this Treaſure.</note>1 This Treaſure is chiefly compounded (ſaith <hi>Coeffeteau</hi>) of the ſuperaboundance of Ieſus Chriſt his merites: in which ſpeech beſide the abuſe, there is plaine mockery, for he is deceiued in thinking that the merites of Ieſus Chriſt can be deuided into partes; and that a part of his ſatisfaction may be withdrawne (from the reſt) and put into a treaſury. The pooreſt man muſt be ſaued by the death of Chriſt, and hath neede of his whole ſatisfaction. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as all the light of the Sunne doth wholly ſhine
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:11466:152"/>in one place, and wholly ſhine in another place, and as all the wordes of an Orator doe at once ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue to the eare of euery hearer, ſo euery beleeuer muſt neceſſarily lay hold vpon the whole merites of Chriſt for his ſaluation: not as theſe men dream, one man vpon one part, and a ſecond on another part, by which meanes Chriſt may leaue certaine portions for the Pope to husband and ſtore vp in his treaſury: being as abſurd, as if I ſhould ſeeke to ſaue a part of the light, or reſerue a peece of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours voyce. Were there fewer beleeuers, they ſhould neede Chriſts whole ſatisfaction, and all his merites. And were their number doubled a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times, they ſhould all finde in the death of Ieſus Chriſt a full redemption. Spirituall graces are entirely poſſeſſed and without diuiſion, and there is no gathering of broken peeces. Conſider farther that euery one of vs hath deſerued an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite puniſhment, and therefore that euery of vs needeth a ranſome of infinite value, and ſuch there is none but the alone death of our Sauiour: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it alſo followeth, that there can be no diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of any part of his merite; for things infinite admit no diuiſion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 For playner euidence, I aske of theſe my Maſters, to whom Chriſt Ieſus hath offered his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and the merite of his paſsion, and to whom he hath payde this ranſome? I ſuppoſe they wil acknowledge with the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that Ieſus Chriſt hath offered this oblation to God, the Father: and then God hath receiued this obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:11466:153"/>ſatisfactory at his hands: if then he haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted it, they muſt tell me, when he was diſpoſſeſt of a part of this merite, to put it into the Popes cuſtody? Is it lawfull for vs in matters of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and where the participation in the me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rites of Ieſus Chriſt is in queſtion to forge Articles of faith without any warrant of Gods word, nay without any teſtimony of antiquity?</p>
                     <p n="3">3 I ſuppoſe alſo, that they will not deny, but the Pope is one of the number for which Chriſt Ieſus hath paide the ranſome of his Father. Is it not then a monſtrous imagination to conceiue, that any one accepting a ranſome for a multitude of Captiues, ſhould turne it backe to the handes of ſome one cheefe priſoner to apply it to the reſt? which cannot fall vnder any mans vnderſtanding.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Now if any man bring me any reaſon, why it is neceſſary that the Pope ſhould be the Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and the Diſpenſer of a part of Ieſus Chriſt his merite, that ſelfe reaſon ſhall be found in the olde Teſtament: for then had the beleeuers as much neede of Gods mercy, and our Sauiours bounty: and yet not any of our aduerſaries hath hitherto dared to affirme, that in thoſe dayes the high Prieſts had the ouer-plus of Chriſts merites vnder their lockes, in their treaſuries: for yet they haue not beene bold-fac'de enough to propoſe matter ſo ridiculous.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Now if the merites of Ieſus Chriſt were then onely in the hands of God, and none are partly in the power of the Pope, whence is it that Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:11466:153"/>are more freely graunted, yea to the verie dead, which in thoſe times was not practiſed. It muſt needes be ſaid that by this theſe new expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent benefites of Ieſus Chriſt are farre better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed: or that the Pope the Depoſitary, is more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen-handed then God the proprietary. And in all this where is there any the leaſt ſhew of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion?</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The ſecond part of this Treaſure.</note>The other part of this Treaſure is the ouer-plus of the ſatisfactions of Saints, and Monkes, that (as <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> ſaith) <hi>haue ſuffered more then they haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is a prodigious doctrine.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 It is to accuſe God down-right of iniuſtice, to thinke that he doth inflict a heauier puniſhment vpon a man, then he hath deſerued.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 It is an ouer-ſleight regard of the grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne, to imagine that the afflictions of this life can make ſatisfaction for ſinne: ſatisfaction being vnderſtood for the acknowledgement of a fault, and humble repentance is a thing both holy and neceſſary. But our aduerſaries by ſatisfaction doe vnderſtand the bearing of the puniſhment, and paying of the ranſome for ſinne, to ſatisfie the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Almighty: againſt which I affirme, that if the calling of a brother foole deſerue hell fire, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5 If the ſlaundering of ones neighbour deſerue aſhutting out from the Kingdome of heauen, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. which in ſhew are but ſleight offences, and doe befall the moſt righteous, when ſhall we be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make ſatisfaction for one ſinne of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:11466:154"/>And if a man be vnable to ſatisfie the iuſtice of God for his owne ſinnes, how ſhall he haue any ſurpluſage, or ſuperfluity of ſatisfaction to tender vnto him? for this were to ſay vnto God, thou ſhalt haue this aboue the bargaine.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 But is not this an indignity to ioyne the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite merite of Ieſus Chriſt in ſuch ſort, as to cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with it Monkiſh ſatisfactions, that is, Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, Pilgrimages, wearing of Sacke-cloth, a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliers girdle, and a hood, to patch vp our ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction vnto God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 But who can tell whether God will accept the ſuperfluity of theſe ſufferings of Saints and Monkes in paiment for the ſinnes of another? And let it be graunted that S. <hi>Frauncis</hi> or S. <hi>Dominicke</hi> haue giuen themſelues more laſhes, and ſuffered more then their ſinnes deſerued: Who knowes whether God will allow this ouer-plus vnto me, or that it ſhall bee my acquittance before him?

Some of late deſirous to mitigate the matter; ſay, that the ſatisfaction of Saints are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by vertue of Chriſts ſatisfaction: but this comes all to one, for Chriſt Ieſus hauing plenarily ſatisfied and paide for vs, giues no power to Saints or Monkes to pay a Debt already diſcharged, nor to ſatisfie for that which already hee hath fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 And we neede not feare that any of their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are loſt, ſeeing God hath rewarded the troubles of the faithfull with glory infinitely, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then their afflictions, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>The afflictions of this life doe not match the glorie that ſhalbe reuealed.</hi>

                     <p>S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> indeed in his Serm. <hi>de Lapſis,</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> in his booke of Chaſtity, and <hi>c.</hi> 1. of his book <hi>Ad Martyres,</hi> ſpeakes of Martyrs held in durance for the Goſpell, at whoſe interceſſion the Biſhop receiued excommunicate and repentant perſons into the Church: But, 1.

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:11466:156"/>that Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the ſixth, in the extrauagant <hi>Vnigenitus,</hi> ſpeaking of the merites of Ieſus Chriſt in the Treaſury of the Church, ſaith,<note n="*" place="margin">Ad cuins the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauri cumulum beatae genetricis &amp; omnium ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum merita adminiculum praeſtare noſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuntur.</note> that <hi>The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of the mother of God and of all the elect doe ſerue as helpes to encreaſe this Treaſure:</hi> As if the merites of men did ſo aſſiſt the merites of Ieſus Chriſt, that this Treaſurie could not be filled, if the merites of men were detectiue. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> makes the caſe worſe, for in conſideration of theſe ſatisfactory ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Saints, which he ſaith are allowed vnto vs, and which the Pope turneth to the forgiuing of our ſinnes; he affirmeth that the Saints are after a ſort our Redeemers: in the firſt booke of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, the fourth chapter.</p>
                     <p>Touching our owne ſatisfactions, his ſpeech driues to this point, <hi>That beſides our owne, there is no actuall Satisfaction,</hi> and that Chriſt hath not actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied for vs, but only hath giuen power to our ſatisfactions. This is to affirme, that the Apoſtle is deceiued, in ſaying that Ieſus Chriſt is giuen a ranſom for vs, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. ſeeing he doth only enable vs to pay our ranſome, and make our owne peace: ſo in the ſecond booke of Indulgences,<note place="margin">Si quis poſt gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiam reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis adeptam: adbuc ſit reus luendae paenae temporatis, is non ne eſſario egetur meritis Chriſti.

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:11466:157"/>ſhould ſay vnto God, thou wouldeſt acquit me, but I will not haue it ſo: for my owne troubles and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions ſhall make thee ſatisfaction. Theſe men haue courage in them indeede, they dare neglect e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Chriſt himſelfe: for it is not good to be too deepely engaged to him; and tis a credite for a man to ſatisfie for himſelfe: whence it followes, that the diuell, that makes long ſatisfaction with euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting torments, ſhall purchaſe the more credire. Beſides it is a goodly ambition to giue vnto God more then we owe him, by performing theſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogatory ſatisfactions; for ſo it is to be feared that God finding himſelfe indebted to ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Friers may bee in danger of turning banck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt. O ſpirite of blaſphemy, and prophanation of the Goſpell! O wonderfull patience of the Lord! But now let vs take a view how this ſuperfluity of ſatisfaction of the Saints is diſtributed.</p>
                     <p>The Pope opens this Treaſure, and drawing thence ſpirituall graces,<note place="margin">Of the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the treaſure of the Church.</note> doth variouſly make diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of them: ſometimes hee giues particular priuiledges to certaine Orders, and Fraternities. So Pope <hi>Sixtus quintus</hi> in the yeare 1586.<note place="margin">In the booke of Indulgences graunted to the Cordeliers printed at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris by <hi>Iean le Bouc</hi> 1597.</note> the ſeuenth of May, graunted to all thoſe of the Order of the Cordeliers; that on the Eue of Palme-ſonday, and on Midſomer Eue, and on the Eue of <hi>Io. Port-latin</hi> ſhall ſay fiue <hi>Pater-noſters, and as many Aue-Maries,</hi> a Pardon for all their ſinnes, beſide the power of eaſing one ſoule in Purgatory. And in as bountiful a manner hath the Pope graunted to the Order of the Friers Carmelites a priuiledge, that they ſhall
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:11466:157"/>continue in Purgatorie no longer then the Sater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day after their departure.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes againe the Pope diſperſeth certaine holy graines, and hallowed Croſſes, the ſaluting of which with an <hi>Aue-Mary,</hi> doth purchaſe a Pardon for a hundred yeares, or peraduenture a plenary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence. Our Kings Ambaſſadours comming from Rome, doe ordinarily bring with them ſuch gratifications.</p>
                     <p>His Holineſſe is alſo pleaſed to ſend vnto diuers places certaine priuiledged Altars, vpon which if a Maſſe or two chance to be vttered, they redeeme a ſoule out of Purgatory. The Church of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uillans at Paris hath this priuiledge, that euery Maſſe that is there ſung for the dead on the Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day or Wedneſday doth redeeme a ſoule from Purgatory; for the Maſſes ſaid on other dayes, haue no ſuch vertue in them: to which purpoſe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effetean</hi> could haue alleadged ſome place of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> but that he bethought him not of it.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer the Pope opening this Treaſure, doth now and then graunt certaine liberatory Bulles from Purgatory, in fauour of ſome perſons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and at the inſtance of their parents: which Buls are paide for in Ducats of the Chamber: at the end whereof there ſhould not be written <hi>Datum Romae, dated at Rome,</hi> but <hi>venditum Romae, ſolde at Rome.</hi> For there is no reaſon, that this treaſure ſhould be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the ſoule of euery monileſſe beggar.</p>
                     <p>But the moſt ordinary manner of this diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that the Pope ſets downe ſome proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:11466:158"/>or number of Pardons for certaine Churches, in ſome more, in ſome leſſe. We haue a booke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly written of Romane Indulgences, printed at Rome by <hi>Iulio Accolto, Ann.</hi> 1570. out of which take this example among a thouſand others. <hi>In the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of February vpon Septuageſsima ſonday, for going the Station vnto S. Lawrence without the walles, there is graunted a plenary Indulgence, beſide a pardon for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuen thouſand yeares, and forty eight Quarentaines, and remiſsion of one third part of all ſinnes, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of a ſoule out of Purgatory.</hi> This is one of the high Holy-dayes. <hi>Vpon the Wedneſday after S. Lucy, being Ember-weeke, the Station is to S. Maryes the greater, for which an Indulgence is graunted for eight and twenty thouſand yeares, and as many Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentaines, and remiſsion of one third part of ſinnes, yea and a plenary pardon for all ſinnes.</hi> The ſame booke ſaith, that for each dayes repaire to S. <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi> Church, a pardon is vndoubtedly graunted for threeſcore and eighteene thouſand yeares, and as many Quarentaines; and that on euery All-Saints day, there is in al the principal Churches ſixe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares of an infallible pardon.</p>
                     <p>But eſpecially his Holineſſe doth grow prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall in the diſſipation of this Treaſure in the yeare of Iubile, which is now celebrated euery fiue and twentieth yeare, hauing made a kinde of circle of ſinne, as it were a ſolar reuolution of the forgiuing of ſinnes, then Indulgences flie thicke abroad, and the Pope doth freely and fully pardon all ſinne: the place of this Iubile, are the Stations at Rome,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:11466:158"/>prouided that they bee reſorted vnto for thirty dayes, whether of conſecution, or intermiſſion it matters not: then Pilgrims flocke from all partes, and one Nation enuying anothers quarrels, and blowes are often exchanged among them: the next yeare after, his Holineſſe conueyes the Iubile ouer the Alpes, and withall ſendes the ſame ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall fauours to two, or three places in Fraunce, and ſo in Spaine. Now if death chaunce to take any out of the world in this yeare of Iubile, no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but he goeth ſtraight to Paradice: but he that vnfortunately dies the yeare before, his lot is to frie in Purgatory, and muſt miſſe of this pontificall bounty, vnleſſe the Pope by a ſpeciall pardon doe priuiledge him from this fire.</p>
                     <p>But hence ariſe ſundry other inconueniences, for in places not aboue fifty or a hundred leagues from the place where the Iubile is kept, ſuch as are well horſed, and haue mony in their purſe, doe eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine pardon for their ſinnes; but he that hath ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther horſe, nor money for his iourney, is excluded from this great happineſſe: for why is he ſo beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly? Or wherefore ſhould he want horſe fleſh? Or why is he ſuch an Aſſe, that he ſhould not finde himſelfe a good paire of legges? and therefore ſhal haue no remiſſion of ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>And therefore it is a goodly matter to dwell at Rome, and be at the Well-head of theſe pardons, without running ſo farre after them; neyther is it credible that any that dwels at Rome, vnleſſe he be a very lob, ſhould goe to Purgatory, for there is
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:11466:159"/>the ſpring of ſpirituall graces: and a man may eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day get fiue or ſixe hundred yeares of Pardons, which is forſooth a gallant prouiſion at the yeares end. Let the Reader take his counters and caſt vp the reckoning.</p>
                     <p>Now if any ſhall atreſt a Pilgrime trauelling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Iubile, this is a caſe of ſpeciall reſeruation, and from a ſinne of this high nature, none of this ſide the Alpes can giue abſolution:<note place="margin">Bulla de Caena Domini de caſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus reſeruatis.</note> marry for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or adultery, or ſuch ſinnes as offend onely the law of God, and hinder not the Popes profite, the matter is more eaſie: for we muſt obſerue, that in the Buls of pardon, this clauſe is ordinarily inſerted that theſe Pardons are granted <hi>manus porrigentibus adiutrices,</hi> to ſuch as put forth helping handes: for which purpoſe there are Trunckes and Cheſts ſet at the gates, and euery one is exhorted to ſpit in the Baſon. Theſe high dayes of Pardon are euen the Faires of Babylon, and by theſe the banke of mony-changers is ſet vp anew in the Temple, which Chriſt ouerturned. And indeede if you ſhould ſay ten times as many prayers, and that with farre more zeale and deuotion, in any other Church, then where theſe Indulgences are affixed, you ſhould notwithſtanding goe without any Pardons: for they are faſtened to certain places, for feare leſt theſe contributions being diuided, and paſſing through many handes, would vaniſh into nothing. So that the King of great Britaine doth both iuſtly and elegantly ſay, that this abuſe is rightly called the treaſure of the Church.</p>
                     <pb n="307" facs="tcp:11466:159"/>
                     <p>Now to proue that the Pope hath intelligence with God, and that he hath preciſely calculated his reckoning with him, hee doeth often limit his Pardons with a ſubtilty full of merriment. As at Paris in the porch of a Chappell belonging to the Friers Feuillands, in the Suburbes of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> there is a long liſt of Pardons to bee ſeene, which among other things tell vs, that on euery day of Lent a Pardon may be obteyned for three thouſand, eight hundred, three ſcore and ſeuen yeares, and two hundred and ſeuen quarentaines of dayes: there are many of the ſame ſtampe.</p>
                     <p>But I long much to know, that if a man ſome few dayes before the day of iudgement ſhould get a hundreth thouſand yeares of Pardon, whether theſe Pardons ſhould any thing auaile him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if a man needing a Pardon but for ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares, ſhould obtaine a Pardon for a hundred thouſand, what ſhould become of the other foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ten thouſand: but aboue all the reſt, it is a point furmounting our capacity, how theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, that doe plenarily forgiue all ſinnes, and ſhould beſides remit a third part of a mans ſinnes, and yet further giue another eighteene thouſand yeares of Pardon: as if one ſhould ſay, that the Pope pardoneth all our ſinnes; and many of our ſinnes beſides: It makes me alſo to wonder very often, why the people doe ſo zealouſly flocke to the Iubile at Rome, ſeeing they may as eaſily, and at all times obtaine a plenary Pardon for all their ſinnes.</p>
                     <pb n="308" facs="tcp:11466:160"/>
                     <p>I forbeare at this time to iudge bad (I ſpeake it with greefe and with commiſeration) whether in this whole Argument there be any the leaſt foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep of Chriſtian Religion to be diſcerned: or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coueteous gaine did euer trample godlineſſe vnder foote in a viler manner.</p>

                  <p>He that ſhall well vnderſtand the great vertue of bels, will not wonder at all, if the people of the Romiſh Church haue thought that baptiſme doth of right belong vnto them; ſith that one peale hath power to carry ſoules into heauen, and eſpecially the ſoules of rich men: for if a rich legacy be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, all the bels in the towne ſhall ringe a requiem for the ſoule departed: but the poore ſhall haue leaue to die without any ſound.

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:11466:162"/>Homily of <hi>S. Iuuentius</hi> and <hi>Maximus,</hi> ſaith, that men doe viſite and adorue their Tombes, and touch their Reliques with faith, to the end they may receiue ſome bleſſing thereby: <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> in the two and twentieth booke of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God, ſpeaking of three perſons that were cured with the touch of certaine Reliques. He alleadgeth no one teſtimony of holy Scripture; it hath no voyce in the Chapter: and yet hee skips at once ouer the firſt foure hundred yeares after Chriſt; for the auncienteſt of theſe foure wrote about the end of the fouth age.</q>

                  <p n="1">1 To begin then with the word of God: Wee read in the olde Teſtament that the bodies of the holy Patriarches haue beene enterred,<note place="margin">

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:11466:162"/>But we finde not at all, that the body of <hi>Elizeus</hi> was for this taken out of his graue: neyther that the people did kneele to his bones, that they brought any offerings vnto it, or that they kiſſed or carried it in proceſsion.</p>

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:11466:163"/>mention at all? Why doth he not alleadge ſome paſſage of Scripture, wherein the worſhip or vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the linnen, or ſhadowes, or Sepulchres is mentioned? who will be perſwaded, that a learned man affirming a matter ſo full of vntruth, ſhould haue any conſcience in him. So in the beginning of the third Chapter, hee falſely alleadgeth theſe wordes out of the eleuenth of <hi>Eſay, ver.</hi> 10. <hi>His Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre ſhall be glorious:</hi> for it is in the Hebrew, his reſt ſhall be glorious: whereunto let this be added, that there is no word in that place of any worſhip performed to this Sepulchre.</p>
                  <p>Now that the point in difference betweene vs may be vnderſtood, wee diſpute not whether the bodies of Saints, and Martyrs may be reſerued re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectiuely, or in caſe their Sepulchres were vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently placed, or ridiculouſly expoſed to prophane inſolencies, whether it be lawfull to remoue their bodies to ſome other place: for thus farre we agree. And his Maieſty of England proteſteth that if hee certainely knew any Reliques, which were indeede the body of any Saint, he would honourably burie them, and keepe them with reſpect; for if men doe curiouſly affect the ſight of the monuments of aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Kings, or pagan Emperours, who ſhould be ſo prophane, as not to deſire the ſight of the Tombs of the Apoſtles, and of thoſe ſacred lights, whoſe glory ſhineth euen after their death? Or who in this regard would not be touched with a louing reſpect to them, and their memory? But the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, whether wee muſt performe any ſeruice to
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:11466:163"/>theſe Reliques? or muſt adore them? or ſpeake to things without life, or offer vnto bones, or clothes? or whether God haue commaunded to lay them vpon Altars, or carry them in proceſſion?

                  <p>Now wee require our aduerſaries to ſhew vs ſome commaundement of God, or ſome example out of the holy Hiſtorie for this adoration, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip: for whatſoeuer diſtinction of worſhip they may produce, is alwaies ſuch a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and religious worſhip, as God hath not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, and is conſequently compriſed vnder that worſhip which S. <hi>Paul</hi> condemneth, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.

                     </gap>, that is, will worſhip, or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie deuotion.</p>
                  <p>And there can bee no Religious worſhip how meane ſo euer, but turnes to an abuſe, when it is transferred to a dead thing: Sith that the Church of Rome doeth ſpeake to theſe reliques, and ſalutes the Napkin, the Speare, the Teares, the Croſſe, ſaying, <hi>Aue ſancta facies, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Aue lignum tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphale.</hi> And hee that ſhall obſerue with what zeale the people is caried to the Adoration of theſe Reliques, ſhall find that the ſeruice of God in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon thereof is key-cold. At Paris, when the Caskets of S. <hi>Geneueifues,</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Marcellus</hi> Relickes, being carried about, come to meete each other, the people are made to beleeue, that the bearers haue much adoe to plucke them aſunder, they bee ſuch ſociable Reliques and louing bones, that they ſhould haue beene lodged in one Tombe to giue them contentment; In this ſolemnitie it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee the zeale of the people, and with what a tumult they throng and preſſe to come neere to it. All the Angels together haue not the one quarter of this honour. And the Soules of <hi>Moyſes, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Noe, &amp;c.</hi> are much leſſe honoured then Saint <hi>Francis</hi> breeches, or a peece of his Pilgrims ſtaffe.</p>
                  <p>It is to ſmall purpoſe to ſay that this is done in honour of the Saints. For it ſhould firſt be ſhewed, that God hath commanded it: Secondly, we ought to be well aſſured, that the Saints are well pleaſed with this ſeruice. Add further, if a King ſhould put off his Doublet, I thinke there is no man (vnleſſe
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:11466:164"/>he haue his wits crazed) that would ſalute it, much leſſe to ſay vnto it, <hi>God ſaue thee Doublet;</hi> as they doe in the Church of Rome, where men ſay, <hi>I greete thee O teare;</hi> And <hi>God ſaue thee O triumphall wood.</hi> If you ſalute any thing in honour of Ieſus Chriſt, or of whomſoeuer, it ought in reaſon to vnderſtand what you ſay.</p>
                  <p>And here we haue the firſt ſtrength of antiquitie on our ſide, <hi>Euſebius</hi> in the fourth Booke,<note place="margin">Nullus ad Aegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptum meas per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferat reliquias, ne vano corpus honore ſcruetur.

Saint <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> in the life of S. <hi>Anthonie,</hi> is moſt pregnant to this purpoſe, where he ſaith, that theſe were the laſt words of <hi>Anthony</hi> when he lay dying; <hi>Let no man carie my Reliques into Egypt, for feare leſt my body be honoured with vaine honour, for feare leaſt Obſequies, and Funerall ſolemnities (which I haue bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as you know) be practiſed vpon my ſelfe; For I am eſpecially returned to this place to auoide it; doe you then hide and couer this poore body with earth, and obſerue the commandement of your aged father, that no man beſide your ſelues, know the place where I am buried.</hi> Out of this place appeareth, that the Chriſtians e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from that time, were exceſſiuely giuen to ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nour the bodies of the beleeuers that died: And we muſt not thinke, that <hi>S. Anthony</hi> was afraid that the Chriſtians would adore him for GOD after his death. For <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doeth acknowledge that
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:11466:165"/>which indeede is a truth; <hi>That</hi> * <hi>it was neuer heard that any Christians did conferre Diuine honours vpon the Reliques of Saints.</hi> The cuſtome of the ancient Church, was to burie the bodies of Martyrs, and not to put them in Caskets out of the ground to carie them about in Proceſſion. In the eight Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Acts of the Apoſtles, the Chriſtians doe there burie <hi>Steuen</hi> without mention of any ſeruice done vnto his body. The ſame was done to <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carpus,</hi> as <hi>Euſebius</hi> witneſſeth. Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> had appointed the place, which was vnder the Altar or the Communion Table for his buriall, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by his laſt Epiſtle; for in thoſe dayes the Altar was moſt commonly a Table of wood, eaſie to be remooued, ſo that the pauement vnderneath might well be broken vp to lay a dead body.<note place="margin">Gaudens autem quae aderat mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudo corpora Sanctorum dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genti tradidit ſepulturae.</note>

What it was that mooued this Emperour to doe it, is another matter: But I ſay that the Biſhoppes of that time, would neuer haue ſuffered that to haue beene done, if they had thought that any Religious ſeruice or adoration had beene due to thoſe Nayles.</p>

For in the fift Councell of Carthage, the Altars are called Monuments or Tombes: Where is to be noted, that the Councel complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that many ſuch falſe monuments were ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted vpon dreames and vaine illuſions, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth to plucke them downe, if the tumult of the people ſhall not hinder them: which ſheweth that ſuperſtition was already growne ſtrong in this point. <hi>Gregorie</hi> Biſhop of Rome in the firſt booke of his Dialogues chap. 2. ſpeaketh of one called <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertinus,</hi> who alwaies carried about a hoſe of <hi>S. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norate.</hi> In thoſe times, our Kinges planted their whole Religion in founding of Monaſteries and getting Relikes together thinking by theſe means to be ſaued. King <hi>Dagobert</hi> tooke away all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques from the other Saints, to enrich the Temple of <hi>S. Denis, S. Ruſticus,</hi> and <hi>S. Eleutherius;</hi> whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there fell out great ſtrife and debate among the Saints, if wee beleeue the Chronicles of France. For the Saints whom he had robbed and riffled, as <hi>S. Hilarie, S. Fremin, &amp;c.</hi> adioyned themſelues to the Deuils,<note place="margin">See this Story in <hi>Nicolas Gilles</hi> anno 645. and it is taken out of Turpin.</note> &amp; craued their helpe to carry the ſoule of this good King to hell; But hee cal ed to the Saints, whom he had enriched, for ſuccour, who ſo valiantly reſiſted the other Saints and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, that they plucked away his ſoule from them, and carried it into Paradiſe. Now a daies many ſuperſtitious perſons are aſhamed of their reliques
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:11466:167"/>and mocke at them; And yet for all that, it is held for an abſolute and inuiolable Decree, that euery Altar muſt haue his Reliques vnderneath it, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they cannot conſecrate. For after the <hi>Introite</hi> of the Maſſe, the Prieſt bowing himſelfe ouer the Altar, asketh of God pardon of al his ſins, through the merits of thoſe Saints, whoſe bones lie hidde vnder the Altar. This greatly auaileth to ſtrike the people with a ſuperſtitious horrour, and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of hart, and with a trembling deuotion, it being done out of ſingular wiſdome, and vpon great conſideration. For it is credible that when Chriſt did adminiſter his laſt ſupper, that he cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conueighed vnder the table, ſome bones of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> or ſome tooth of <hi>Sampſons</hi> Aſſes law bone; And if Chriſt did not ſeeke ſaluation throgh their merits, it was becauſe thoſe old Saints were worſe ſtored and prouided of merits, then they whom the Pope hath Canonized for Saints, as <hi>S. Iuniper,</hi> or <hi>S. Thomas</hi> of Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terbury, defender of the crowne of England.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Fathers, whom <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth hereunto; <hi>Chryſoſtome, Ambroſe,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> are of the minde that the bodies of the Saints ought indeede to be honored, and their ſepulchres beautified and adorned. But what is this againſt the King of England, who ſaith aſmuch. As for thoſe miracles which were done at thoſe Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres, of which <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> ſpeaketh, God by them did authorize the doctrine of the Goſpell, which his faithfull ſeruants had vttered in word, and ſigned
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:11466:167"/>with their bloud. Such were the miracles wrought by the touch of <hi>Elizeus</hi> his body, and by the Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes of <hi>S. Paul:</hi> But it followeth not thereupon, that they adored or yeelded any religious ſeruice to thoſe Reliques. Vnleſſe perhaps we muſt adore the ſhadow of <hi>S.

The other is, that the place in <hi>S. Auſtin De Ciuitai. Dei lib.</hi> 22. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. is to be ſuſpected For he ſpeaketh of miracles done in Africa, and neare vnto Hippo, where he was Biſhop, by touching the Reliques of Saints. Whereas himſelfe <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 137. ſaith that in ſome places of Italie, as at <hi>Nola</hi> and at <hi>Millan,</hi> ſuch miracles were done neare vnto the monuments of the Saints: but that in Africa there were not any wroght in any place; And that which is more to be obſerued, is, that this Epiſtle was written to the people and clergie of Hippo, who would eaſilie haue controuled him, if ſuch miracles had beene wrought in Africa; What ſhall we now beleeue? Here is <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> who ſaith in one place,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:11466:168"/>that many miracles were done in Africa neare vnto the place of his abode; by the Reliques of Saints: In another place he ſaith there were non done at all. Surely the writings of the Fathers paſſed throgh certaine ages, horribly darkened with ignorance, in which ſome malicious men tooke a pleaſure to falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them. And indeede by the courſe of Storie of the ages following a man may obſerue, that by how much the more ignorance increaſed by corruption of doctrine; by ſo much the more miracles were wrought. Reade the Dialogue of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the firſt, and you ſhall ſee that Chriſt did nothing in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, &amp; in compariſon of the miracles then wrought. <hi>Gregorie</hi> himſelfe in the fourth booke of his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues chap. 41. wondereth at it, and propoundeth this quetion to himſelfe:<note place="margin">Quid hoc eſt quaeſo, quod in his extremis tem poribus tam multa de anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus clareſcunt quae ante latue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant?</note> 
                     <hi>How commeth it to paſſe that in theſe latter times ſo many thinges are reuealed vnto vs, touching the ſoules of the dead, which before were bidden.</hi> For then in thoſe times, men talked of nothing but of Ghoſts that appeared, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted men liuing to giue to the Church. And it was yet but the ſixt hundreth yeare of Chriſt, ſo much had the Prince of this world gotten in ſhort time.</p>
                  <p>That which <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> moſt maketh bragges off, and ſetteth it out with faireſt colour, is the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>S. Hierome,</hi>

The reaſon is giuen, that no eye euer ſaw God; and how can we paint his face, when</hi> Moſes <hi>(the man that euer was moſt familiar which God) neuer ſaw but his backe parts? Surely, ſince he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be drawne to the</hi> viue, <hi>it is a thankeleſſe labour to marre it with a falſe repreſentation, which no Prince, nor ſcarce any other man will be contented with in their owne pictures.

                  </p>
                  <p>For anſwere whereunto <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> ſaith, <q>that the Images of God are not made to repreſent his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but onlie to expreſſe the formes wherein he hath appeared. That none is ſo brutiſh to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that any can paint an eſſence immortall, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:11466:184"/>
                  <p>I expected that <hi>M. Coeffeteau</hi> would haue produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſome commandement of God; for his ground of the Images of God; or ſome place to ſhew that God was pleaſed, to haue his Images made, ſeing they are not made to repreſent his eſſence: at leaſt ſome auncient example either true, or falſe, after his old manner. But here is none of theſe, he only ſaith that Images doe not expreſſe his being. I anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were that this may bee ſaid aſwell of the Images of men, yea of beaſtes: for their pictures doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent their eſſence, and neuer was any man ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable as to thinke that the eſſence of anie thing could be expreſſed in a picture. Then in like manner doe I ſay, that if theſe Images be not the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of God, becauſe they repreſent not his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, then the Images of Saints are not their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, becauſe they repreſent not their eſſence. And indeed not the vulgar people only, but the Doctors alſo doe call ſuch pictures the Image of God, and the Trinitie, The title of the eight chapter of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmines</hi> booke of Images, is this, <hi>That the Images of God are not forbidden.</hi> Now there is no picture, which hath not ſome reſemblance with the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne, and euery Image is a likeneſſe. Therefore, our aduerſaries muſt hold that there is ſome aſsimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and reſemblance betweene God, and his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, for if there be none, they are not the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of God.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe Statues and pictures are to be ſeene in all their Churches, and in the beginning of the Bibles printed at Rome by the authority of <hi>Sixtus
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:11466:185"/>Quintus</hi> and <hi>Clement</hi> 8. yea, they ſerue for ſignes at Tauerne dores, they vſe to ſay Maſter <hi>N.</hi> lodgeth at the <hi>Trinity:</hi> and his horſes are ſet at <hi>Gods-head,</hi> a matter ridiculouſly prophane, and reproachfull to Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                  <p>It appeareth alſo that theſe Images of God, are not made to repreſent the formes wherein God hath appeared, for they commonly picture God in a pontificall Throne, in the habite of a Pope with a triple Crowne, and a Papall robe; as if you ſhould ſay, behold Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> granting pardons. There wants nothing but a fanne of a Peacockes taile on either ſide, ſurely God neuer appeared in this habite, it makes me wonder whence it comes; that the Images of the Trinity are commonly du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and Spiders playing about them, but the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of our Lady, and of the Saints, are diapred, and trimply appaireled: me thinkes in regard of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall habit, at leaſt they ſhould be neatly kept.</p>
                  <p>It is true that God appeared vnto <hi>Daniel</hi> in the ſhape of an old man, for he knew well that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> would not Idolatrouſly abuſe the viſion, but when he ſpeakes to the children of Iſrael, hee ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them not to ſee him in any likeneſſe, for feare (ſaith he) leaſt ye corrupt your ſelues in making a repreſentation of any figure, of Male, or Female <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.16. And me thinkes when they obiect this apparition in the figure of an old man, they knock themſelues on the fingers. For did the Church then vpon this occaſion repreſent God in that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure? can it be found that after that time the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:11466:185"/>of God was painted in the Temple, or in the Synagogue? And if the faithfull in thoſe daies did it not for what reaſon ſhall we haue licenſe to doe that which they thought vnlawfull. God doth that which ſeemeth good to his wiſedome, but to vs it belongeth to doe what he commaundeth, for his commandemen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

An abhominable Doctrine, giuing to a dead creature as great worſhip as vnto the high God; which cannot be excuſed, that this worſhip of the Croſſe hath relation vnto God, or is referred vnto Ieſus Chriſt: for to adore Ieſus Chriſt, and to adore the Croſſe in honour of Ieſus Chriſt, muſt needes bee two different adorations, We muſt not in honour of God, adore the creature with honour equalling the worſhip of God; for in ſeeking thus to honour God, we ſhall diſhonour him; reproach him by ſuch worſhip; by ſuch reſpect diſreſpect him; neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect him by ſuch ſeruice: in a word, this is to make <hi>ex oppoſito appoſitum,</hi> to deſcend in clyming, and to get heate by freezing. Beſides, what honour, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect ſoeuer you may ſhew vnto the King, it can neuer be made good, that any can honour him the more, by giuing like reuerence to his chaire, or his cloke: the chief point is, that if ſuch worſhip of the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:11466:190"/>Croſſe be lawfull, then hath God commaunded it. For we may not adore any thing, but what he hath commaunded vs to adore: and here are our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries tongue-tied, and alleadge no one word of Gods commaundement.</p>
                  <p>This is the reaſon why Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thinkes it better to ſay, that the Croſſe ought to be worſhipped with an inferiour adoration: wherein he plainely confeſſeth, that the adoration of the Croſſe differs from the adoration of Ieſus Chriſt, in that it is inferiour: and ſo his meaning is that the dead creature be worſhipped in it ſelfe, and with a differing worſhippe from that by which Chriſt is worſhipped, Secondly, he doth thereby confound the vnderſtanding of the poore people, who when they fall downe before the Croſſe, thinke of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming no more then one worſhip: but <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will haue them to performe two ſeruices, one to Chriſt, and the other to the Croſſe, and in the one inſtant to cut their deuotion in two peeces, deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their thoughts betweene two kindes of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips. It were extreamely abſurd to hope, that hee, or any other ſhould produce any commandement of God touching this religious worſhip ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the worſhip of Chriſt; without ſaying, that the people adoring a piece of the Croſſe, muſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly beleeue that it is a piece of the true Croſſe, and that it is not ſuppoſitious: whereof notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding there can be no aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>For the other kinde of Croſſe, which is the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Croſſe in woode, or ſiluer, the Church
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:11466:191"/>of Rome doth worſhip that alſo: and at the eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, they ſay, <hi>Ecce crux, adoremus.</hi> And therefore Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the thirtieth chapter of his booke of Images, ſpeakes thus: <hi>We worſhip all Croſſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. Ad quartum. Omnes cruces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doramus quia omnes ſunt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines verae cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</note> 
                     <hi>becauſe they are all Images of the true Croſſe: yea the bare Croſſes without a Crucifix. We worſhip</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Croſſe, yea without Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All which is a Medley of abſurdity with impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For none worſhippeth the Image of the Croſſe with like worſhippe, as hee doth the true Croſſe: and if the true Croſſe be to be adored with a worſhip ſubordinate to that yeelded to Chriſt, then behold three ſorts of religious worſhip. Now if we muſt adore a Croſſe without a crucifixe; for that it is an Image and reſemblance of the Croſſe; why doe they not worſhip the barres of windows, or the Sayle-yardes of Ships, ſeeing they reſemble the Croſſe of Chriſt? Why ſhall we not worſhip all the nayles, and all the linnen clothes in the world, ſeeing they better reſemble the nayles which pierced our Sauiour, and the linnen clothes that wrapped him in his infancy? Whereunto if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny obiect, that theſe common nayles and linnen, are not in any conſecrated place, nor appointed to that end, nor purpoſely made to ſerue as Images, or memorials of the Paſſion, or birth of Chriſt: I anſwer, that this is to graunt as much as we deſire, and to fall into the like impiety: for this is to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that common nayles and ordinary linnen ought to be worſhipped, if they were carried into
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:11466:191"/>ſome holy place, and appointed to ſerue for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, or commemoration of Chriſts paſſion; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> our aduerſaries wil be vnwilling to grant: And wherfore then doe they adore all maner of Croſſes, yea without crucifixes, aſſoone as they are put into ſome holy place, and ordayned to repreſent the paſſion? For if the queſtion be of the touching, the linnen touched the body of Chriſt as neere as the Croſſe; yea I ſay, that the nayles and Iron of the Speare touched him nearer, euen to the very heart: and then whence is it, that the nayles and Iron of the Speare put into a holy place, are not adored as well as the Image of the Croſſe? And where is the adoration of this Image commaunded by God?</p>
                  <p>To be ſhort, I ſay that if any ſhould doe obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, or ſpeake vnto the kings cloake, although the king did weare it, he ſhould neuertheles be thought to be beſide himſelfe. How much more if he ſpake to the cloake, or did obeyſance to it, when it is han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vpon a hooke? And yet how much more, if he ſhould ſalute or talke to the picture of this cloake? In like manner I ſay, that if any had ſaluted the Croſſe, whiles our Sauior was faſtened thereunto, or had ſpoken vnto it, hee would haue beene thought to haue beene madde, although his ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation had beene relatiuely made vnto Chriſt. How much more then if he had ſaluted it alone, Chriſt not being thereon? And how much more, if he had ſaluted or ſpoken to the picture, or Image of this Croſſe? eſpecially to a bare Croſſe without a crucifixe, as at this day the Church of Rome doth?
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:11466:192"/>Certainely no wordes can ſufficiently expreſſe the abſurdity of this abuſe.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> doth giue no manner of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that which his Maieſty of England doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect: namely, that if the Croſſe ought to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped becauſe it touched Ieſus Chriſt; then <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> his mouth, and the handes of thoſe that buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, and the land of Canaan whereon he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, which is at this day an example of Gods curſe, ought alſo to be worſhipped.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> anſweres, that the reaſon is not alike, becauſe the lips of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and the handes of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners, were their liuing members that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him ſacrilegiouſly: but the Croſſe was a dead thing, and a guiltleſſe Inſtrument of the death of our Redeemer. This is but a bare ſhift: for firſt, if our Sauiours touching had made dead things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorable, it ſhould much more haue made prophane things holy. Our aduerſaries haue alſo forged a fable of one S. <hi>Longis,</hi> that with hate and inſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pierced his ſide, and thereby became a Saint. And ſecondly, the Croſſe (as <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> ſaith) is not to be worſhipped the more, for that it was a dead thing: Thirdly, the water wherewith Chriſt was baptized, obteyned no life thereby, and (to ſpeake with <hi>Coeffeteau</hi>) it was an innocent Inſtrument of his baptiſme; and did touch Chriſt, and yet was neuer adored Fourthly, our aduerſaries (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) would not worſhip the empty Chalices, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they did beleeue that the bloud of Chriſt, yea his whole body had beene therein. They will
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:11466:192"/>not adore the Prieſt, albeit hee haue often eaten God, and that he come to take Chriſt a freſh into his ſtomacke: Fiftly, the whips wherewith Chriſt was bloudied, were harmeleſſe Inſtruments of his ſufferings, yet wee finde not that euer Chriſtian worſhipped them: Sixtly, nothing touched Chriſt ſo neare, as the nayles and ſpeare that pierced him, and they were alſo harmeleſſe Inſtruments of his paſſion, and yet the primitiue Chriſtians neuer worſhipped them. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> put two of them into his Helmet, and of two others he made a Bitte for a Horſe; wherein he had ſome ſeedes of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition: yet had <hi>Conſtantine</hi> adored theſe nayles, he would haue cauſed them to bee put into the Church, rather then to haue put them into the mouth of a Beaſte, and left them hanging on a poſt in the Quirry:<note place="margin">Ambroſ. de obi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu Theodoſu Theodor.

                        </gap>.</note> and yet <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> approue this action: Seuenthly, if the nayles touched the body of Chriſt nearer, and his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts deeper then the Croſſe, why doe they not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the Image of the nayles, and yet they adore the Image of the Croſſe, yea without a crucifixe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> addeth, that there is more in the Croſſe beſides the touching, for it is a repreſentation alſo of the death of Ieſus Chriſt. If he ſpeake of the true Croſſe, it is not true that it repreſenteth the death of Chriſt. For that of the Croſſe, which they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip now adayes, is but little peeces of worme ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten woode, which haue neyther figure nor faſhion of the Croſſe. But if he ſpeake of the Image of the Croſſe in ſiluer, or paynting, it is falſe that Chriſt
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:11466:193"/>euer touched it. And if theſe Croſſes be without crucifixes, they doe not reſemble the paſſion. For there is no Image of the paſſion, where there is no Image of him that ſuffereth; it may be ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance but no reſemblance.</p>
                  <p>The Reader ſhall alſo note, that <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> omits that excellent obſeruation which the King makes touching the bodily touch, and the touch of fayth; and the example of the woman that touched the hemme of Chriſts garment, as alſo the example of that woman that ſaid, <hi>Happy is the wombe that bare thee;</hi> together with the reaſon which he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently draw, from the perſon and the ſhadow of <hi>Peter:</hi> and the compariſon of Images condemned by the Prophets, which haue eyes and ſee not, eares and heare not, with the Croſſe which hath no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of eyes or eares. This Doctor ſuffers all this ſweetely to ſlide a way, and honeſtly holdeth his peace; hauing of ſet purpoſe (in my opinion) made his booke a foile to giue luſtre to the King of great Britaines booke.</p>
                  <p>After all theſe abuſe, theſe our Maſters haue the good grace, to accuſe vs of miſpriſion of the Croſſe of Chriſt, who ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>Galat.</hi> 6. <hi>God for bid that I ſhould reioyce in any thing but the Croſſe of our Lord Ieſus.</hi> Our aduerſaries talke of the Croſſe of Chriſt, but we practiſe it; they paint it, wee beare it; they glory in ſome peeces of the Croſſe, but we in ſuffering for his name; they paint it on walles, and we print it in our hearts: many carry it toſſing vpon their body, whoſe belly is an
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:11466:193"/>enemy of the Croſſe of Chriſt. Let vs learne then to faſten our affections to his Croſſe, and to cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our olde man with him. But for the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Croſſes of golde or ſiluer (for the mettall is honoured) we ſay with the auncient Chriſtians in the Dialogue of <hi>Minutius Foelix, Cruces nec colimus nec optamus, We neyther worſhip, nor wiſh for Croſſes.</hi> He doth vs wrong that thinkes, that we reiect this ſigne and memoriall of the paſſion, we onely wiſh the abuſe and Idolatry to be reformed.</p>

                  <p>In this point of ſuch great conſequence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the benefites of Chriſt, and the cleanſing of our ſinnes are handled, it were very behoouefull for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> to bring ſome proofes out of the word of God, whereunto the King of great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines wordes doe binde him, ſeeing he reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> with ignorance of any one paſſage of the Scripture whereon to ground his Purgatorie: and therefore hee cals the other Doctors to aſſiſt the Cardinall, and ſupply this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault.</p>
                  <p>In ſteed whereof <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> ruſheth vpon the Fathers, and ſaith, <q>that the Fathers haue prayed for the dead, and that prayer for the dead were to no purpoſe if there were no Purgatory.

That the Scripture doth expreſly make but two places, for ſoules to remaine in, after this life, but when it ſpeakes in this manner, the meaning is of places eternall. But that Purgatorie is a place, where they continue but for a time; to wit, vntil they haue ſatisfied the iuſtice of God, and that they are cleanſed from thoſe corruptions which hinder them from entring into the heauenly Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.

                     </p>
                     <p>This purging fire is grounded vpon this maxime drawne from the vnwritten Word, that Chriſt by his death and ſufferings, hath freed vs from the fault, and from the puniſhment of ſinnes before baptiſme,<note place="margin">This is clearly expounded in the Tridentine Catechiſme in the chap. of penance.</note> baptiſme, but that it doth not diſcharge vs from the puniſhment of ſinnes committed after baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me: for which we muſt ſatisfie the iuſtice of God both here, and in Purgatorie: that no vncleane
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:11466:195"/>thing entreth into Paradice, and therefore we muſt be purged firſt that this purging fire is one of the meanes whereby to apply the ſatisfaction of Chriſt vnto vs. This fire ſhall laſt till the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that it is farre hotter then our ordinarie fire; all the torments of this life being nothing in compariſon thereof; and that ſeauen yeares tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be endured for one ſinne: which is the reaſon why the Pope doth graunt pardons of fifty, and of a hundred thouſand yeares, for according to the wound, muſt the playſter bee the broader.

                     <head>The deciſion of this difference by the word of God,</head>
                     <p n="1">1 IN the firſt place it is to bee wondered that God who in his law appointed ſacrifices, and expiations for all ſorts of ſinnes and pollutions, euen for the leaproſie, iſſues of blood, and the touching of the dead, that he ordained nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expiation, nor ſacrifice, nor ſatisfaction for ſoules in Purgatorie. The faithfull in thoſe dayes wept ouer the dead, but neuer mingled their teares with prayers for their deliuerance from this fire. Did God ſuffer the faithfull then to make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and full ſatisfaction? Had he then leſſe care for his children then he hath now? Had he then no priuiledged Altar? Had he then no worſhip for the dead? Had he then no Church-treaſurie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into the Prieſts might gather the ſatisfactions of <hi>Noah</hi> or <hi>Abraham,</hi> to giue ſome parte thereof to theſe roaſted ſoules? There appeares no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or that God had yet bethought himſelfe of it.
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:11466:197"/>And yet the Church had continued foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares, when Chriſt came into the world: for touching that in the twelfth chapter of the ſecond of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> beſides that wee haue proued in the fift Article, that the booke is Apocryphall, we ſhall hereafter ſee, that the prayer for the dead, which is there mentioned makes againſt Purgatory.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 In the Goſpell, and the writings of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles there is no ſhew of this matter; no Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences graunted for the dead, no prayer for any departed, nor any commaundement to pray for them, nor any colour whereby it may be gathered that the ſoules of the faithfull are yet in torments.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Contrariwiſe we finde many examples of men that by death haue entred into Paradice, and haue beene gathered (to their Fathers) in peace: good old <hi>Simeon</hi> was promiſed that he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in peace after that he had ſeene the Meſsias, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that after he had fought a good fight, there was nothing left for him, but to receiue a Crowne of glory, 2. <hi>Tim</hi> 4. The ſoule of <hi>Lazarus</hi> (<hi>Luke</hi> 16.) was carried by the Angels into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, where he was comforted, while the wicked rich man was tormented; but of going in, or comming out of Purgatory, there is nothing ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt ſaith vnto the good theefe, <hi>To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradice:</hi> then hee went not to Purgatory; for firſt, his faith could not deſerue this priuiledge, for hee had no other faith then that which Chriſt gaue him, for it can be no merite to
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:11466:197"/>receiue grace from God: Secondly, And he that giues Paradiſe to him that had but a weake faith, doth conſequently ſay, that if wee haue a ſtrong faith in Chriſt, wee ſhall not goe to Purgatorie: Thirdly, beſides, no vertues can be ſatisfactory pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, but ſhould rather mitigate the penalty; ſo then faith, which is a vertue cannot ſatisfie the iuſtice of God, which requireth puniſhment ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory: Fourthly, if any ſhal cal this a priuiledge to be exempted from Purgatory, he is bound to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome other examples, to prooue that others doe ordinarily goe into Purgatory: Fiftly, Againe the torments which he then ſuffered, could not be his Purgatorie, for our aduerſaries ſay, that this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction muſt be voluntary, and done with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſatisfie God: Now this theefe was brought to his puniſhment againſt his will, and had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to ſatisfie Gods iuſtice, to free himſelfe from Purgatory: Sixtly and laſtly, there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion betweene the bodily paines of a few ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, and a fire that laſteth thouſands of yeares: out of all peraduenture Purgatory was crucified with this theefe.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The Angell of the Lord, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14.13, ſaith thus: <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, So ſaith the ſpirit, that they reſt from their labors, and their workes follow them.</hi> If they reſt from their labours, they doe not frie in a burning fire: He that ſhall read the whole chapter, will confeſſe that hee ſpeakes not onely of Martyrs, who are not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in any part thereof, but of thoſe <hi>that keepe the
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:11466:198"/>commaundements of God, and the faith of Ieſus.</hi> For if Martyrs alone die in the Lord, in whom do the reſt of the faithfull die?</p>
                     <p n="5">5 The Prophet <hi>Eſay, cap.</hi> 57. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. ſaith, that the righteous is taken away from the euil to come, and that he reſteth in peace.

                     <p n="6">6 In the eighteenth chapter of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> God ſaith, that if the wicked ſhall turne from his ſinnes which he hath committed, hee will no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his iniquities: is this to remember them no more, to plague them with a long, and burning fire, and to make the ſinner pay the vttermoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?</p>
                     <p n="7">7 In the twentieth of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> all the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers which wrought in the Lords Vineyard, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued their ſalary at the end of the day, which is this life, and when they had done their worke.

                     <p n="10">10. Obſerue farther, that our aduerſaries hold, the ſoules in Purgatory, are abſolutely righteous, and ſinne no more: whence it followes, that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory is a purging of ſpots that are not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for to beare the puniſhment of by paſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is no purgation: for this torment cannot be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a Purgatory, but a Cruciatory, or a Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: ſeeing ſoules are there tormented, but not purged of any ſpot, or pollution, of which they haue none.</p>
                     <pb n="386" facs="tcp:11466:199"/>
                     <p n="11">11. The worſt is, that this puniſhment by fire after the fault is wholly forgiuen, doth wither and diſparage Gods iuſtice: for thereby they teach that God puniſheth thoſe which are not culpable: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none is puniſhed with ſatisfactory paines, but for his fault: the fault then beeing remoued, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Ieſus Chriſt, there is noſatiffactory paine left: as <hi>Tertullian, cap.</hi> 5. <hi>de Baptiſmo,</hi> hath, <hi>where there is no guilt, there is no puniſhment.</hi>

                     <p n="14">14. Whereunto adde, that Chriſt hath not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe borne our ſinnes, then he hath borne the puniſhment of them: and if he haue borne that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory puniſhment: which we owed vnto Gods iuſtice, was it not to diſcharge vs thereof? As S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten</hi> in his 37. Sermon <hi>de verbis Domini,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chriſt in taking vpon him the puniſhment, and not the guilt,

                     </p>
                     <p>Obſerue in this whole diſcourſe, that when wee ſpeake here of puniſhments, we alwaies vnderſtand puniſhment ſatisfactory, by which,<note place="margin">Fol. 71. pag. 8.</note> (as <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> ſaith) <hi>The ſinner doth ſatisfie the iuſtice of God:</hi> and ſuch a puniſhment and the forgiuing of ſinne, are incompatible: but there are other puniſhments, which are fatherly corrections, and ſauing exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which God inflicteth, not to draw ſatisfaction for that which is paſt, but to make vs wiſe for after times:<note place="margin">Non exigens ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicium de pecca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tis, ſed ad futura not corrigen.</note> as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith in his Homily of confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and repentance. Corrections are not reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and medicines are no ſatisfactions: for ſo was <hi>Dauid</hi> puniſhed after his offence was pardoned. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. wee agree well with our aduerſaries that his ſinwas the efficient cauſe of his puniſhment: but we differ about the finall cauſe. They ſay, that it was to ſatisfie the iuſtice of God, and we ſay it was to cure the iniuſtice of <hi>Dauid:</hi> they ſay, that God puniſhed him as a iudge, but we ſay, that he corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him as a father.</p>
                     <p>So that the puniſhments which ſerue for the amendment of the ſinnes, agree well with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of the ſinne: iuſt as to forgiue an iniury recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from a brother, and yet to ſtrike him being fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into an apoplexie to awake him, are thinges compatible. But to pardon the ſinne, and yet to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort ſatisfaction by puniſhments, whereby the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is not bettered, and then when he needes no premonition for future times, is a matter vniuſt, yea contradictory, as the reaſons formerly alleadged doe demonſtrate.</p>

                     <p n="16">16 I aske him farther, whether Chriſt haue not ſatisfied by his death for the paines of Purgatorie, and whether hee haue not paide ſufficient for our ranſome: for if he haue paide ſufficient, why will not God receiue his payment, for as much as it amounts vnto? Why ſhould he abate any thing of the price of his ſonnes death?

                     <p n="1">1 I ſay then that not our aduerſaries, but the ſacred Scripture muſt preſcribe vs the meanes of enioying Chriſt and his benefites; and the meanes which are therein offered vnto vs, are faith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. The Sacrament of Baptiſme, <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.27. The bread broken in the Lords Supper, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. The word of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17.

How then doe they apply vnto vs the benefites of Chriſt, which is the remiſſion and cancelling of our debts, in forcing vs to make payment? Will they haue a pardon to be applyed vnto vs by our puniſhment? Or will they haue the merite of Chriſt, which is the ſupreame teſtimony of Gods mercy, to be applyed vnto vs by the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his iuſtice? Chriſt hath ſuffered torments to deliuer vs from torment, but (theſe men tell vs) the application of the fruit of this deliuerance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in our torments: this impiety is baſely ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd.</p>

His meaning is, that the bloud of Chriſt giueth power to the fire of Purgatory to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie Gods iuſtice, and to purge our ſinnes. This he onely ſaith, not prouing it by Scripture, and it is againſt common reaſon: for the bloud of Chriſt doth not giue power to any thing in the world to pay a debt, that is paide already, and to ſatisfie for that, for which himſelfe hath made full ſatisfaction. God exacteth not two payments for one debt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when the firſt payment (made by Chriſt) is more then ſufficient.</p>
                     <p>But he is mightily ouer-ſeene in mixing fire and torment with the graces of God, turning in the middeſt of this fire, the bloud of the eternal ſonne of God. For if it be Gods mercy, to enable any one to ſatisfie his iuſtice by ſuffering of torments: Thence ſhall it follow, that they that ſuffer moſt, receiue moſt mercy from God, and that the Diuels
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:11466:201"/>are his fauourites, from whom he drawes a full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
                     <p>Then al theſe reaſons which he propoſeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Scripture, are but matches without brimſtone, that cannot kindle this imaginarie ſire, that hath beene purpoſely inuented for lucre. The Biſhop of Rome hauing built this burning priſon, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe might be the Iaylor, and let out ſoules by his Indulgences, and merchandiſe of Maſſes, which are as profitable to the Prieſts, as vnprofitable to the dead: which doth clearely diſcouer both abuſe, and tyranny. For if the Pope be able, eyther by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Iuriſdiction, or by way of Suffrage (as they terme it) to bring ſoules out of Purgatorie; why doth he deliuer no more thence? Why doth hee leaue ſo many thouſand ſoules to lie downe in this ſire, being able to ſet them free? But that he heedes not: for ſhould he bring out the ſoules that haue burned there for many ages, an infinite number of Maſſes, and other gainfull ſeruices would faile, and euery one would ſay, the Pope will preſently deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer me; and therefore I neede not begger my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to erect Maſſes after I am dead.</p>

                     <p>This is then one reaſon why the Fathers allowed prayer for the dead: ſeeing that they thought that their ſoules were either in hell, or els did ſleepe, or lay in certain receptacles: in a word, that they were yet in ſuſpenſe, and in doubt of their ſaluation, and that in thoſe cells and dortours, they receiued ſome comfort &amp; refreſhing by the prayers of the liuing.</p>

                        <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath his opinion apart, for he would haue men to pray for the dead, to the end that they might riſe the ſooner. For he beleeued that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection ſhould not be all in one day.

                     </p>
                     <p>Another reaſon why they prayed for the dead, was, that they beleeued that the faithfull at their departure out of theſe places of durance, were to be purged and ſinged as it were by the fire of the laſt iudgement, ſome more, ſome leſſe.

                     <p>It would be infinite here to produce (that which we haue elſe-where done) the authorities of the Fathers, who affirme that there are but two places for the ſoules, to wit, Heauen for the damned, and Paradice or a place of reſt for the Beleeuers: and that the ſoules immediately after their departure out of the body, goe into a place of reſt, or into ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall glory.

And you ſhall not finde that S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> eyther in this place or in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, makes this Diſtinction of places eternall and temporall for the ſoules; ſeeing that S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in thoſe places doth of purpoſe diſpute againſt the <hi>Limbus puerorum,</hi> and relecting all temporary pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he acknowledgeth no other third place.</p>
                     <p>Out of all that hitherto hath beene ſpoken, I draw theſe two concluſions: 1. The one is, that the Fathers being ſo vnreſolued in this point, and ſo tainted with erronious opinions, which our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries reiect as well as we; they are no way fit to be Iudges to decide this matter: 2. The other is, that the prayers which they make for the dead, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Church of Rome, ſeeing that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth no other prayer for the dead, but that which is made to eaſe the ſoules in Purgatorie: and by conſequent alſo doth reiect the prayers of the Auncients, for the reſurrection, and refreſhing of the ſoules that lie and ſleepe in their ſuppoſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles: As alſo the prayers vſed in the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church, for the Saints and Martyrs. Whence the Reader may informe his iudgement with what care and circumſpection the Fathers ought to be
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:11466:208"/>read, ſeeing it is ſo hard a matter to vnderſtand their termes, and to finde out their meaning. But we now liue in an admirable age, in which all the world is become learned without ſtudy, and in which they who ſcarcely vnderſtand their Pater noſter, ſpeake of the Fathers both Greeke and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, with an incredible aſſurance.

O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pointes there are, but this is that for which we diſpute. Whoſoeuer ſhal examine al our Controuerſies, with a iudgement not foreſtalled, nor pre-occupied, ſhall finde that euery errour is a pillar of the Popes Empire, and a prop of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and that the Articles of Faith haue beene skilfully bended and fitted to the aduantage of his Holineſſe.</p>
                  <p>To this may be alſo added, that if the Pope can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre in the deciſion of doubts: the caſe is then cleare, without further difficulty. Neyther ſhall it be needefull hereafter to aſſemble Councels, nor to ſearch into Scriptures, but onely to conſult this Papall Oracle, and ſo to content our ſelues with what it determineth.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore vpon iuſt cauſe, that his Maieſty ſaith this point is the principall Controuerſie, and therefore inſiſteth vpon it, more then vpon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therein diſplayeth the admirable ability of his wit, of which I confeſſe, I am rather a learner then a defender, hauing firſt learned to ſpeake of him, before I did ſpeake for him.</p>
                  <p>But before he entreth into the matter, he ſaith, <q>that to haue Biſhops in the Church, is an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolique Inſtitution, and appointed by God, and ſaith, that he hath alwayes abhorred <hi>Anarchie:</hi> and that in heauen the bleſſed ſpirits are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by diuers degrees, and that the very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:11466:210"/>themſelues, are digeſted and parted into Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, and haue their Princes; that by the ſame reaſon, no humane ſociety can ſubſiſt without this order, and difference in degrees: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon complayneth of certain turbulent perſons that haue perſecuted him, euen from his mothers wombe, purſuing his death before he entred into life.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But who theſe perſons were, that with ſo haſty murther would not haue expected his birth, it is beſt knowne vnto his Maieſty: and it is not to bee doubted, but they haue beene puniſhed according to the lawes. And for ſuch any puniſhment is too little. But it is true that there is nothing ſo turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent as an Anarchy, in which there is no Maſter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe euery one is ſuch a one, where euery one by being too free becommeth a ſlaue: for in a State it is better to be vnder an ill Maſter, then vnder none at all; and Tyrannie is more tollerable then ſuch a freedome which vnder the title of liberty, introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth licentiouſneſſe, and this licentiouſneſſe bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in extreame ſeruitude. So is it in Families and Common-wealths, in Armies, yea euen amongſt the Angels themſelues; yea if we diſcend to Bees, and Cranes, wee ſee not theſe meaner creatures without a naturall pollicy, and a kinde of ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
                  <p>The Church is no way exempt from this order in which God hath eſtabliſhed Paſtors and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and aboue them Aſſemblies, which the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church called Synodes and Councels; of
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:11466:210"/>which it is likewiſe neceſſary, that ſome one ſhould be <hi>Preſident</hi> to direct and order the buſineſſes.</p>
                  <p>But if one demaund, what differences of degrees theſe ſhould be, or whether one man ſhould haue ſuperiority ouer one onely flocke, or ouer many? It is another queſtion, and tendeth nothing to the kings purpoſe, which is only to withſtand the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of one ſingle man ouer the vniuerſall Church. For admitting it ſhould be yeelded, that in euery Countrey and Prouince, there ought to be one ſoueraine Prelate: It would not follow thereupon, that therefore there muſt be one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch ouer all Prelates, or one head of the Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church, no more then if a man by proouing that a Monarchy is the moſt exact forme of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, ſhould by that conclude, that therefore there muſt be one Monarch ouer the whole world. No, there are no ſhoulders of ſtrength enough to beare ſo great a head: the prouidence of no one man can ſtretch or extend it ſelfe ſo farre, or deuide it ſelfe into ſo many peeces: Such Countries as are placed vnder an other Hemiſphere, and fall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tyranny of Lieftenants and officers, ouer whoſe gouernement a carefull eye could not be had. The ſame inconuenience or rather much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would be in the Church: for beſides this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, pride is much more pernitious in Diuine, then in humane things. And it would be very hard that any man ſhould climbe ſo high, but that his head would be giddy: for if pride get in amongſt beggars, whom we ſee quarrell and conteſt, whilſt
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:11466:211"/>whilſt they ſit ridding themſelues of vermine, how much more would it faſten it ſelfe to ſuch a height of glory, which inueſteth a weake man, and many times a vitious, with the title of the head of the Church, which title the Scripture giueth not but to the onely Sonne of God.</p>
                  <p>Now the end and ſcope of the gouernement of the Church, and of Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline, is the peace of the Church, the reformation of manners, ſuppreſſions of ſcandals, and the conſeruation of the purity of doctrine: to which end I conceiue we may attaine by different wayes. And he ſhould be raſh, that would tye all other Churches to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Eccleſiaſticall policy, which is practiſed in his owne Countrey; or by a peeuiſh preſumption preſcribe his particular example, for an vniuerſall rule. Farre is it from the charitable opinion of the King of England, who towards the end of his book declareth, that he no way intendeth to condemne thoſe Churches, which hold a differing forme of gouernement, ſince in the grounds, and in all the points of doctrine, we fully agree with the Engliſh Churches, which are our brethren in our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, members of the ſame body, ſenſible of our common greefes, and whoſe quarrell we eſteeme to be our owne, as perſons tending to the ſelfe ſame end, and by the ſelfe ſame way, though cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed perhaps in colours differing. For the ſuſpition of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Coeffeteau,</hi> is ill grounded, when vpon the proteſtation which the King of great Britaine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, that he diſliketh the Puritanes, hee inferreth,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:11466:211"/>that his confeſſion of faith, publiſhed in Scotland, was a ſuppoſed confeſſion, made by the Scottiſh Miniſters, in which they make him ſpeake like a Puritane; for that confeſſion agreeth in ſubſtance with that which the ſame King inſerteth into his booke: the defence whereof we vndertake. But if in <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> his opinion, to pray to God onely, in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, to denie the fire of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to reiect the Popes Indulgences, to pray in a knowne tongue, and to abſtaine from Idolatry; if this be to be a Puritane, there is none of vs that had not rather be a Puritane with the Apoſtles, then be impure with the Biſhop of Rome. So that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty by the ſame wiſdome, by which he prudently gouerneth his Kingdomes, can well diſcerne in this matter of Eccleſiaſticall gouernment, betwixt ſuch of his ſubiects, as oppoſe themſelues meerely for contradiction, and whoſe heat is accompanied with contempts: from ſuch who though they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſomewhat in opinion, yet walke in obedience and with a good conſcience, deſiring nothing more then the eſtabliſhment of his Throne, and are ready to lay downe their liues for his ſeruice: ſuch are the faithfull Miniſters, who carefully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelues to root out thoſe tares which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than ſoweth whilſt we ſleepe, and to pull vp Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry out of mens hearts; the encreaſe whereof being nouriſhed by our petty diſcords, cannot chooſe but be a weakening to the greatneſſe of Kings, and the diminution of their Empire: for it is certaine,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:11466:212"/>vnto himſelfe in England, ſo many ſubiects his Maieſty doth gaine vnto his Crowne, ſeeing that according to the rules of Popery, a King is an vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, if he be not approued by the Pope, and that his ſubiects are bound to rebell, aſſoone as the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Vatican haue beene caſt forth vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſoueraigne Prince. And ſeeing that alſo the Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> dareth to affirme, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that England is part of the Popes Demaines, and that the King is Feudatory and Vaſſall to the Biſhop of Rome. It is to be preſumed that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty hath ſent him his picture, drawne out of the <hi>Apocalips,</hi> to pay him his Arrearages, and to yeelde homage to his Lord in cheefe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things conſidered, the beſt meanes to be reuenged of ſo great an iniury, is to giue order, that the people bee carefully inſtructed, and that the Countrey Churches be not vnprouided of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Paſtors, who may watch carefully ouer their Flockes, and may expound plainly the benefites of Ieſus Chriſt, and the doctrine of the Goſpell: In preſence of which, Poperie doth vaniſh and fall downe, as DAGON fell before the Arke of the Couenant.</p>

They were ignorant of the true nature of Ieſus Chriſt, but they well knew what was the Eccleſiaſticall policy, and how farre the bounds of the Biſhop of Rome did extend. And if it be found in ſtory, that <hi>Iulius</hi> Biſhop of Rome wrote his Letters, to re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrate any expulſed Biſhops into their Charges; we finde alſo that <hi>Liberius</hi> Biſhop of Rome,<note place="margin">Scribunt literas Faelici tum Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae Romanae Antiſtiti, &amp; Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro eiuſdem Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae, vti Liberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um recipiant &amp; ambo pariter Eccleſiam Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicam admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strent.</note> being put from his Biſhopricke, is ſent backe with the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Eaſterne Biſhops, and by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement re-eſtabliſhed, as <hi>Sozomen</hi> witneſſeth <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. And yet this is not taken vp for a proofe of ſuperiority of the Eaſterne Biſhops ouer the Biſhops of Rome; but to teſtifie the mutuall helpe which the Churches lend one to another in their neceſſities: no more then when we read in the ſtory of <hi>Socrates, l.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 33. that <hi>Cyrill</hi> of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria depoſed <hi>Neſtorius</hi> Biſhop of Conſtantinople, &amp; that <hi>Neſtoriꝰ</hi> degraded <hi>Cyrill:</hi> as alſo that <hi>Iohn</hi> of Antioch, and <hi>Cyrill</hi> condemne &amp; excommunicate one another: this is not a proof of Superiority. So <hi>S. Hilary</hi> Biſhop of Poictiers, in the fragments of his Epiſtles oftentimes ſaith, <hi>Anathema tibi a me Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri:</hi> and ſo excommunicateth the Biſhop of Rome, without any pretence of Superiority ouer him.</p>
                  <pb n="423" facs="tcp:11466:217"/>
                  <p>As for that which <hi>Sozomen</hi> ſaith, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome had the care of all Churches by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the dignity of his Sea; this is true not onely in the Biſhop of Rome, but alſo of all the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches. Thus haue we heretofore ſeene that <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> Patriarch of Alexandria had the care of all Churches, as <hi>Baſil</hi> had of his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, and that the Patriarch of Antioch was ouer the whole body of the Church. We haue alſo but euen now produced an example, in which the Biſhops of the Eaſt, ſhew to haue had care of the Weſt. But this point hath neede of more cleare demonſtration.</p>
                  <p>To fetch the matter then a little higher, we muſt vnderſtand, that from the firſt Nicene Councell, held <hi>Anno</hi> 328. the Hiſtories doe make manifeſt, that in the auncient Church Biſhops had prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency each of other, according to the dignities of their Cities; which precedency was without any Superiority or Iuriſdiction ouer one another. No more nor leſſe then the Counſellors of the Court, goe in rancke according as they were admitted, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be equall in charge. Or as when Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes, or their Ambaſſadours meete toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deliberate of the affaires of Chriſtendome, one hath precedencie and place before another, yet without rule or dominion one ouer another. So fared it with the Patriarchall Seas: there was the Biſhop of the firſt ſeate: the Biſhop of the ſecond, and ſo in order. The Biſhop of the firſt Sea was the Biſhop of Rome, for the dignity of his Citie,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:11466:218"/>becauſe it was the ſeate of the Empire: the Biſhop of the ſecond ſeat was he of Alexandria, becauſe it was the greateſt and mightieſt City of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, next after Rome: then followed Antioch and laſtly, Ieruſalem, which had more the name, then the power and authority of a Patriarch; becauſe it ſelfe was ſubiect to the Metropolitan of Ceſarea.</p>
                  <p>Now to preuent, leaſt any vnder the title of preſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or the firſt ſeate, ſhould preſume to challenge and vſurpe Dominion ouer his fellowes: the third Councell of Carthage, Canon 26. ordaineth, <hi>That the Biſhop of the firſt Sea,</hi>

                     <hi>ſhall not bee called Head or Prince of the Prieſts, or high Prieſt and Biſhop, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Biſhop of the firſt Sea,</hi> acknowledging it to be for order ſake, and not for Superiority.</p>
                  <p>But after that the abode and ordinary reſidence of the Emperours began to be in Conſtantinople, together with the forces and ſtrength of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: the Biſhop of Conſtantinople did then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall himſelfe with the Biſhop of Rome, and helde himſelfe in nothing inferiour to him. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon came in the Ordinance of the Councell of Chalcedon, which ſaith, Canon 28. that, <hi>The hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fiftie Biſhops of the Councell of Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, welbeloued of God, haue giuen to the ſeate of new Rome (which is Conſtantinople) the ſame prerogatiues with auncient Rome. Iudging it according to reaſon, that the Citie honoured with the Empire and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and which hath the ſame Priuiledges with aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Rome, ought of right to bee magnified as much as ſhe in Eccleſiaſticall matters, being the next in rancke
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:11466:218"/>after her.</hi> Where you ſee that the Councell put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a priority in order, with an equality in power: And this priority becauſe Rome had beene the ſeate of the Empire before Conſtantinople; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon is to be noted, that <hi>Leo</hi> Biſhop of Rome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth that his deputies conſented to that Article, as appeareth by the nine and fiftie and ſixtie of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles: but the Councell for all that doth not let to goe forward; and I thinke that ſixe hundred and thirty Biſhops (for ſo many there were at the Councell of Chalcedon) are more to be credited then the Biſhop of Rome alone. And that which is more, you ſhall finde the Canon ſet downe at large in the ſixth generall Councell. Which hath moued the Canoniſts to falſifie this Canon: for in the two and twentieth Diſtinction, in the Canon <hi>Renouantes,</hi> in ſtead of theſe wordes, <hi>Etiam in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticis,</hi> they haue put <hi>non tamen in Eccleſiaſticis,</hi> which is a manifeſt impoſture and corruption.</p>
                  <p>That little preheminence then which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome had, from the time of the Councell of Nice, and a long while after, was onely in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Nobleneſſe and greatneſſe of the Citie. For ſo alſo the Patriarches and Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litanes were at the firſt ordained, according to the dignities of their Cities, as appeareth in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non <hi>Prouinciae,</hi> in the ninth Diſtinction. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the Archbiſhop of Rauenna, though it bee almoſt ſituated at the gates of Rome, yet would he neuer yeeld to acknowledge himſelfe inferiour to the Biſhop of Rome, during the time that the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch,</hi>
                     <pb n="426" facs="tcp:11466:219"/>which was the Emperours Lieutenant, made his abode in Italy. Which alſo appeareth, in that the Popes <hi>Boniface</hi> and <hi>Celeſtine,</hi> who liued in the time of S. <hi>Auſten,</hi> being deſirous to haue drawne to themſelues the Appeales of Affrica, and to haue played their Maſteries out of Italy; they alleadge nothing to the Councell of Affrica, where this matter was debated, not any text of Scripture, nor the power giuen by Chriſt to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> but only the ordinance of the Councell of Nice, of which they produced certaine forged Canons. Which falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of theirs being detected and conuinced by confronting it with the Originals brought in place, the Biſhop of Rome had the foile, and loſt the cauſe. And hereof we haue the whole Councell for witneſſe, in which <hi>Aurelius</hi> Biſhop of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, and S. <hi>Austen</hi> Biſhop of Hippo were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; who together with the reſt of their fellowes, wrote letters to <hi>Celeſtine,</hi> which are inſerted into the Councell, and which ſpeake to the Biſhop of Rome in this manner: <hi>The Fathers haue most wiſely and iuſtly prouided, that all affaires ſhould be decided and ended in the places where they ariſe. Neyther will the grace of God be wanting to any place, through which equity ſhall prudently and conſtantly be acknowledged, and embraced of the Miniſters of Christ, ſeeing alſo that it is permitted to euery man that receiueth any greeuance from his delegated Iudges, to appeale to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinciall, or indeede to a generall Councell, vnleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps any man ſhall thinke that God may giue ability to ſome one man to examine things vprightly, which he
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:11466:219"/>will not vouchſafe to a multitude aſſembled in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. Or how can a Sentence or iudgement be of force, that is giuen beyond the Sea, where neceſſary witneſſes ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be preſent, eyther by reaſon of ſex, or infirmity of olde age, and a thouſand other hinderances? For to tell vs, that there ought Deputies</hi> [Legates a Latere] <hi>to be ſent vnto vs as comming from your Holineſſe ſide, it is a thing which we doe not finde to haue beene ordained by any Synode of the Fathers; for thoſe Articles which you ſent vs a while agone by our fellow and Companion</hi> Fauſtinus, <hi>as being of the Councell of Nice, we could not finde it ſo in the true Copies ſent vnto vs by</hi> Cyril <hi>and</hi> Atticus, &amp;c. <hi>Forbeare alſo to ſend vs your Clerkes,</hi> men ready to ſerue euery great mans turne, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any that ſhall aske them;<note place="margin">n="*" Nolite conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere ne fumoſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> typhum ſeculi in Eccleſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſti v deamur indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</note>

<pb n="428" facs="tcp:11466:220"/>in an Epiſtle which is found in the ſecond Tome of the Councels, ſaith, that <hi>Aurelius</hi> and his fellows had ſeparated themſelues from the Church of Rome, being waxen proude through the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Diuell.<note place="margin">In the 20. chap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter of my Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie for the Supper of the Lord.</note> An Epiſtle which witneſſeth, that S. <hi>Austen</hi> died excommunicated out of the Church of Rome, which alſo wee haue elſewhere defended againſt <hi>Coeffeteaus</hi> accuſations.</p>

Thereupon I ſay, that if <hi>Nectarius</hi> had beene ſubiect to the Biſhop of Rome, he would neuer haue vndertaken ſo great a matter without his aduiſe, and contrary to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:11466:221"/>Should a Biſhop of Paris or Lyons bee borne withall now adaies, if of his owne authority, without aduiſe from the Pope, he ſhould put away auricular confeſſion out of his Biſhopricke: Here are other examples.

                     <note place="margin">This Epiſtle is found in the 1.

So the Canon <hi>Aliter</hi> in the 31.

                  <p>So ſhall we alſo finde that the Churches of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, of Syria, and of Egypt, are called Catholique and Apoſtolique Churches, and yet they are neuer called Romane.</p>
                  <p>Eſpecially it is manifeſt, that the Church of Rome, in thoſe dayes did neuer giue the definitiue ſentence, or that her iudgements were eſteemed ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragable not to be gaineſaid, foraſmuch as wee finde examples of ſome cauſes, iudged by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of Rome, which the Emperours haue cauſed afterwards to be iudged by other Biſhops, for the better examination of the matters. <hi>S.

                  <p>It appeareth chiefly in the conuocation and the holding of Councells, how little the power of the Biſhop of Rome was, in compariſon of that which is giuen now adayes. <hi>Damaſus</hi> Biſhop of Rome ſummoned a Councell at Rome, whereunto hee inuiteth the Eaſterne Biſhops, who were aſſembled at Conſtantinople, from diuers places, preſſing them earneſtly to meete together at Rome, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate of common affaires: but the Biſhops of the Eaſt refuſed to be preſent, &amp; excuſed themſelues by letters to <hi>Damaſus, Ambroſe, &amp;c.</hi> whom they call their Brethren and Colleagues, ſaying,<note place="margin">Theſe letters are found in the 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>One of the ſubtle trickes of the Biſhoppes of Rome was, neuer to be preſent at generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, for feare leaſt ſome one of the other Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches ſhould take place before him; euen ſo farre that <hi>Vigilius</hi> Biſhop of Rome, being in the Citie of Conſtantinople, whilſt the fift generall Councell was held there, <hi>Vigilius</hi> notwithſtanding refuſed to aſſiſt, and to be preſent, for feare leaſt <hi>Menas</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:11466:224"/>of Conſtantinople ſhould take the preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. With ſuch a like cunning, when any Biſhop of Aſia, or Egypt, or Greece, was choſen by ioynt conſent of a generall Councell to bee Preſident therein, the Biſhop of Rome well perceiuing, that his Deputies could not haue the firſt place, intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him who was choſen to be Preſident, to keepe his place, and to repreſent his perſon; as he did <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill</hi> in the firſt Councell of Epheſus, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this counterfeit Commiſſion, would not haue let to haue beene Preſident of the Councell: As well as did <hi>Dioſchorus,</hi> who was Preſident in the ſecond Councell of Epheſus, without being Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate of the Biſhop of Rome, and where the Biſhop of Rome had his Deputies, who did not conteſt for the firſt place. The iſſue and the end indeed of the Councell was turbulent, but yet it was lawfully aſſembled according to the vſuall forme, and there was good order kept in the firſt Seſſions. So <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> and <hi>Euticheus</hi> Patriarches of Conſtantinople ſate Preſidents in the fift Councell of Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, albeit <hi>Vigilius</hi> Biſhop of Rome were in the ſame Towne: which doubtleſſe was the cauſe why he refuſed to be preſent at the Councell: All which notwithſtanding after the cloſe and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Councell, he approued the Acts.</p>
                  <p>Read carefully the ſecond Councell of Nice, and you ſhal ſee, that in reckoning vp the Biſhops, who were aſſiſting thereat, hee who hath tranſlated the Acts of the Councell, hath oftentimes placed (to gratifie the Pope) the Deputies of Rome the firſt;
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:11466:224"/>yet notwithſtanding the whole action of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell doth plainely ſhew, that they were not Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents at all: they ſpeake almoſt neuer a word, and they giue in their opinions ſometimes amongſt the reſt. But <hi>Tharaſius</hi> Patriarch of Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſpeaketh to euery matter, gouerneth the whole action, pronounceth the concluſions, and is cheefe Preſident in the Councell.</p>
                  <p>And to come vp a little higher, the moſt famous Councell that euer was, was the firſt Councell of Nice; in which ſurely the Biſhop of Rome was not Preſident: but if we will beleeue the teſtimony of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> who was there preſent, <hi>Hoſius</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Corduba in Spaine, ſate in the firſt place. His teſtimony is reported by <hi>Theodoret</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke of his ſtory, and fifteenth chapter, where he ſaith, that there was no Councell helde, wherein <hi>Hoſius</hi> was not Preſident: And this hee ſpeaketh agreeable to that which the ſame <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> ſaith in his Epiſtle to them that liue in the deſert. The firſt ſpeaker was <hi>Euſtachius</hi> Biſhop of Antioch, who ſate at the Emperours right hand; Which hath made ſome men to thinke that he was Preſident: but it appeareth not throughout the whole action that the deputies of Rome did any thing. In the Tomes of the Councels, though made for the Popes greateſt aduantage, yet <hi>Hoſius</hi> ſubſcribeth the firſt, and the deputies of Rome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. And leaſt any man ſhould ſay that he was the Biſhop of Romes Legate, he ſubſcribeth apart in theſe wordes, <hi>Hoſius, Epiſcopus Cordubenſis, Ita
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:11466:225"/>credo.</hi> Then the deputies of Rome ſubſcribe apart. <hi>Victor &amp; Vincentius Presbyteri vrbis Romae pro vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabili Papa Sylueſtro ſubſcripſimus.</hi> For if they had beene all three deputies for the Biſhop of Rome, they would thus haue ſubſcribed, <hi>Hoſius, Victor, &amp; Vincentius pro Sylueſtro, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Hoſius</hi> ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue taken this title, then to be qualified only Biſhop of Corduba, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whoſoeuer hath neuer ſo little looked into the ſtories, knoweth that the Biſhops of Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, conſidering that the dignity of the ſea of Rome came, for that Rome had for a long time beene the ſeate of the Empire; and ſeeing that the Empire was now tranſlated to Conſtantinople, haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to haue themſelues to be credited and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the Biſhop of Rome. Euen ſo farre forth, that <hi>Iohn</hi> the Biſhoppe of Conſtantinople, whom Greekes call <hi>S. Iohn</hi> the Almoſner, began vnder the Emperour <hi>Mauritius</hi> about the yeare ſixe hundred, to call himſelfe the firſt and chiefe Biſhop, and Oecumenicall Biſhop, that is to ſay V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall. Whereupon <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt, Biſhop of Rome doth not complaine that <hi>Iohn</hi> did ſet foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the Sea of Rome, or that he did him any wrong by vſurping that which belonged to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome: but ſaith, that this was a new Title, and <hi>That he which will be called vniuerſal Biſhop is the forerunner of Antichrist, becauſe that in the Pride of his heart, he preferreth himſelfe before others.</hi> Now the intent of this <hi>Iohn</hi> was not to haue denyed the others to haue beene Biſhops alſo: but he ſaid that
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:11466:225"/>he was the firſt and aboue the reſt. And indeede this <hi>Iohns</hi> ſucceſſors continued this title, and are ſo called in <hi>Zonaras</hi> and <hi>Cedrenus.</hi> And further in the ſecond Councel of Nice, the ſecond Action: there is an Epiſtle of <hi>Adrian</hi> Biſhop of Rome, wherein he calleth<note place="margin">n="a" Dilecto fratri Tharaſio genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li Patriarchae.</note> 
                     <hi>Tharaſius</hi> Biſhop of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople vniuerſall Patriarch. Howbeit <hi>Gregory</hi> in his Epiſtles, thinketh that he who will be vniuerſall Biſhop, doth by conſequent ruine the Biſhopricke of others, and ſeeketh if not directly, yet at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by conſequence, to be the onely Biſhop: the Biſhopricke of others, after that, being nothing elſe but a bare name without ſubſtance, as is the charge of Biſhops vnder the Papacy. Thus hath God pluckt out of the mouth of <hi>Gregory</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of his Succeſſors; for this good man was not aware that in ſo ſpeaking, he called <hi>Boniface</hi> the third his Succeſſour, the forerunner of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, to whom the Emperour <hi>Phocas</hi> gaue the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of vniuerſall Supremacy, within a while after the death of <hi>Gregory.</hi> And yet for all this the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of Conſtantinople, would neuer acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge themſelues inferiors to the Biſhop of Rome; no nor thoſe of Antioch and Alexandria, vntil that the Turkes and Saracens hauing ouerthrowne all the reſt, the Biſhop of Rome onely finding in our Kings ſoft ſpirits, and that they were litle ſeene and verſed in Diuinity, drew from them huge liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, perſwading them to whatſoeuer he would, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to ſubiect their Crownes vnto him, and to pill and rifle their Kingdomes, and to take vpon him<note place="margin">n="b" Gregor. in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtro l. <hi>4.</hi> Epiſt. <hi>32.</hi> &amp; Epist. <hi>24.</hi> &amp; Epiſt. <hi>36.</hi> &amp; Epiſt. <hi>38.</hi> &amp; li. <hi>6.</hi> Ep. <hi>30.</hi> Ad Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricium &amp;c.</note>
                     <pb n="440" facs="tcp:11466:226"/>thoſe Titles, of which we ſhall ſpeake anone. He that wil ſee how much the Pope hath exalted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, let him compare the foure firſt Councels, where all thinges are paſſed by common voices, with the Councell of Florence, in which they gaue power and authority to the Pope, to make new ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of faith: And with the latter Lateran Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, in which all is referred to the will of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, who there is called the diuine Maieſtie, the corner ſtone laid in Sion, the Lyon of Iuda, the King and Prince of all the world, whom all the Kinges of the earth ought to adore. To ſuch Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels the Pope doth willingly affoord his perſonall preſence, becauſe he doth there rule and domineere with abſolute authority: but in the ancient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels he refuſed to bee preſent, becauſe there hee ſhould haue found Biſhops as ſtout and as ſtrong, and as ambitious as himſelfe. Adde hereunto that in the generall Councels, they vſed the Church of Rome and her Biſhop no otherwiſe then they did their particular Churches. So in the ſixe generall Councels, re-aſſembled at the Pallace: Pope <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius</hi> is condemned for an Hereticke. And the thirteenth Canon doth by name condemne the Church of Rome, becauſe it diſalowed the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Prieſts. And further in the 55. Canon the Church of Rome is expreſly forbidde to faſt any more the Satterdy and the Sunday, vpon payne of incurring the rigour of the Canon of the Apoſtles which ſaith,<note place="margin">This is the 65.

Seeing then that <hi>S. Peter</hi> was the ſame among the faithful, that <hi>Iudas</hi> was among the wicked, it followeth, that as <hi>Iudas</hi> was not the head of the wicked, to haue power and Iuriſdiction ouer them, but onely was the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable among them: ſo <hi>S. Peter</hi> ſhould be ſuch a one among the beleeuers. He might haue had perhaps a priority eyther in age, or in vertue, or in zeale, or in eloquence, or in preſeance, and taking the firſt place: but yet without Dominion or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Iuriſdiction. As touching that which ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he ſaith, that the Church is founded vpon <hi>S.

                     <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> thus anſwereth: <q>We know that the Pope is a ſinfull man, as another man is, and therefore may erre in Doctrine and Manners if we conſider him in particular: but in the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>S. Peters</hi> Succeſſour, hee cannot teach any thing contrary to piety.</q> This is it which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid, that the Pope indeede may erre as he is a man and a particular Doctor, but not as he is Pope: Or that he may erre in manners, but not in faith:<note place="margin">Cap. licet. titulo <hi>2</hi> de Conſtitutioni. in <hi>6.</hi>
                     </note> They ſay alſo, that he may erre in the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>de facto,</hi> but not in the queſtion <hi>de Iure.</hi> For (as <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth ſaith) the Pope hath all law and right in the cheſt of his breaſt.</p>
                  <p>A man had neede of a good ſtomach to digeſt this: And I doe not ſee how all this can agree. For firſt if the Pope may erre in the queſtion of fact, it followeth alſo that he may erre in the queſtion of
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:11466:228"/>Right, ſeeing that the one dependeth vpon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: if he may be ignorant, whether Ieſus Chriſt came into the world, or whether hee died for vs, he may alſo be ignorant whether we ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him or no.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe if he may erre in maners, it followeth that he may teach falſe doctrine: for to lie and to ſpeake againſt his conſcience, is certainly a defail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance in manners. If then the Pope cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the true doctrine, and yet through mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſſe will bury the truth, wilfully to deceiue, to what end ſerueth this truth hidden in the Popes vnderſtanding, if the people in the meane time be fed with lies? But this is an abſurdity aboue the reſt, to thinke that the Pope may erre as man, or as a particular Doctor, but not as Pope: for why doth not the Pope correct the doctor? Or when Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> or <hi>Clement</hi> doe erre as <hi>Boniface,</hi> but not as Pope, why doth not <hi>Boniface</hi> aske counſell of the Pope? why dooth hee not conſult himſelfe? why doth he not betake himſelfe from his priuate chaire to the Popes Seate, to the end to change his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? If the Popes diuine knowledge be tyed to his Chaire or Papall habite, it followeth that when he riſeth from his ſeat, or putteth off his Robes,<note place="margin">Titulo. <hi>2.</hi> de Conſtitutionib. cap. licet. in <hi>6.</hi>
                     </note> that withall he ſtrippeth himſelfe out of his knowledge: And that <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight was to blame to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe the Popes knowledge in his breaſt. Shall we thinke that theſe men haue a deſire to be credited, and that by theſe pleaſant diſtinctions, they do not mocke the Pope?</p>
                  <pb n="446" facs="tcp:11466:229"/>
                  <p>Put the caſe that all this may be reconciled, and that the Pope may be contrary to himſelfe, and worſe then himſelfe, and at one inſtant both He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticke and an Orthodox; what doth all this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile the people, ſeeing that in what ſort ſoeuer the Pope teacheth, whether as Pope or as Doctor, he will alwayes be beleeued? Neyther can the people diſcerne theſe ſubtle Diſtinctions.</p>
                  <p>Neyther may wee omit that the Pope vpon Maundy Thurſday doth excommunicate all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes; whence it ſhould follow, that if himſelfe be an hereticke, as man, he is alſo excommunicate, and conſequently is out of the Church: and ſo it ſhould come to paſſe, that the man may be out of the Church, but the Pope be within it; which is as if I ſhould ſay, that the King at the ſame inſtant is within his Palace as King, but without it as man; or that <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> is at the ſame time in the Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory or dyning-hall as Fryer, and without as man; ſo that a man ſhall finde him in two places at once.</p>
                  <p>It was then a great vnhappineſſe to the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers to haue beene ignorant of this Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and to haue aſſembled ſo many Councels, ſo long and ſo painful for the deciding of differents in Religion, ſeing that they needed only to haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed themſelues to the Biſhop of Rome, and to intreate him not as man, or as Doctor, but as Pope to pronounce the ſentence, &amp; giue deciſion of the Controuerſie. Whence alſo it followeth, that then the Popes had but ſmall zeale to the publique
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:11466:229"/>good of the Church, ſeeing that they refuſed to be preſent at generall Councels, which were the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall places in which they ought to haue put on this their Infallibility. As alſo when the Romane Biſhop had giuen his aduiſe by his Deputies, the Councels did not forbeare for all that, to ſound and examine the matter to the bottome, and to heare the opinions of others.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> produceth this Scripture, to ſhew that the Pope cannot erre; he ſaith that our Lord ſaid to S. <hi>Peter, I haue prayed for thee that thy faith ſhould not faile.</hi> Whence he concludeth, that the Pope cannot erre in faith. Surely wee haue no greater proofe of the patience of God, then that he ſuffreth his holy word thus to be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: for firſt, is there any mention here of the Pope? Is all that that was ſpoken to S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpoken alſo to the Biſhop of Rome? If that be ſo, then muſt we needes ſay, that that which our Sauiour ſaid to <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> 16. he ſaid alſo to the Pope, <hi>Get thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde me Sathan:</hi> Secondly, adde that which wee will hereafter ſhew, that the Pope is not the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> vnleſſe it be as ſickeneſſe ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth health: Thirdly, and albeit this had beene ſpoken to the Pope, yet by theſe words Chriſt doth not promiſe to <hi>S. Peter</hi> that he ſhould not erre at all in faith; for it is one thing not to faile, another thing not vtterly to fall away. There be many that miſſe and faile, but yet doe they not wholly miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; whence enſueth, that though Chriſt ſhould haue prayed for the Pope, that his faith ſhould not
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:11466:230"/>vtterly faile, yet can he not for all that be exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from power of erring: Fourthly, if the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of S. <hi>Peter</hi> enter alſo vpon this vertue of his, neuer to erre, then ſhould the Biſhop of Antioch who ſtileth himſelfe <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſor, be exempted alſo from erring: Fiftly, ſeeing that <hi>Saint Iohn, S, Paul, S. Iames, &amp;c.</hi> were no leſſe exempted from this power of erring then was <hi>S. Peter,</hi> why ſhould not their Succeſſours inherite the infallibility of the reſt of the Apoſtles, as well as the Succeſſors of <hi>S. Peter:</hi> Sixtly, but without any more adoe, let vs looke vpon the place, and reade with one breath the verſes following, and we ſhall finde that Chriſt in that place did foretell to <hi>S. Peter</hi> his fall and deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and promiſeth that his faith ſhould not vtterly be vanquiſhed in that temptation: that was then perſonall and peculiar to <hi>S. Peter;</hi> yet ſo that our Sauiour would haue his fall and riſing againe, to ſerue to confirme his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Here by the way the Reader may note, that this Paſſage and Text of Scripture is the onely foundation that the Church of Rome can finde, to prop vp the Popes infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is as if a man would plant and reare vp an huge <hi>Coloſſus</hi> vpon Reedes, or from a thing of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to make a long chaine of Conſequences to depend.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> being put off from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he hath recourſe to the Fathers, and ſaith, that <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> is bold to ſay, <hi>that the Church of Rome is that, to which treachery and falſe hood can haue no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. Cyprian</hi> thereby vnderſtands that it cannot
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:11466:230"/>be the refuge of perfidious men, neyther can they be receiued there to finde ſhelter; which is true of euery Orthodox Church: for <hi>Cyprian</hi> varied from the Biſhop of Rome vpon the poynt of Rebapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation of heretickes; which is an euident proofe that he did not beleeue that the Biſhop of Rome could not erre: and indeede in the Epiſtle to <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius</hi> (written after that which <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) he ſaith that <hi>Stephen</hi> Biſhop of Rome was in an errour,<note place="margin">Stephani errore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> denotabis — inter caetera, vel ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peruacanea vel ad rem non per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinentia, vel ſibi ipſi contraria, quae imperite at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>By <hi>the Kingdome of God,</hi> the Goſpell ordinarily doth vnderſtand the Church of God vpon earth, and conſequently the Keyes of the Kingdome of God ſignifie the Church, to bring men into the Church, or exclude them from it. This is cheefly done by preaching the word of God, which our Lord for that cauſe, <hi>Luc.</hi> 11. calleth the key of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:11466:236"/>vnto which Preaching is annexed, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of admitting ſinners to repentance, and to the peace of the Church, when they are come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the word and ſubmit themſelues vnto it: or if they are impenitent to ſhut them out from the communion of the faithfull.</p>
                     <p>This ſame power is ſignified by the wordes of binding and loſing: for wee are naturally in the bondes of Sathan, but the preaching of the Goſpel freeth and deliuereth vs, when by faith we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it; by which the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, whom Sathan hath fettered, <hi>Luc.</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. And if any man oppoſe himſelfe againſt this word, either by vnbeleefe or of a prophane humor: by the ſame preaching; firſt generally propounded, and after particularly applied to the impenitent ſinner by Eccleſiaſticall cenſure, the iudgements of God and his curſe, are denounced vnto him: the which holdeth the ſinner bound, and are vnto him as chaines, by which Sathan leadeth him captiue, and draweth him with an inſenſible violence into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, vnleſſe by his earneſt repentance hee free himſelfe of thoſe bonds, and returne to God. Here then Ieſus Chriſt ſheweth, that God ratifieth in heauen both the reception of a repenting ſinner, and the reiecting of him that is impenitent; and willeth, that during his obſtinacy, by which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſeth the Church, he be held as a Publican, and an heathen, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17.18.</p>
                     <p>We are then to learne, whether this power was giuen to <hi>S. Peter</hi> alone, or to all the Apoſtles: I ſay,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:11466:236"/>that that which was promiſed to <hi>S.

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 Aſſuredly it is a moſt ridiculous preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to thinke that any man now adayes doth better vnderſtand the wordes of Ieſus Chriſt then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did: But it is more then euident that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did neuer ſuppoſe that by theſe wordes of Chriſt, any ſuperiority was giuen to <hi>S.

                     <p n="3">3 Aboue all things this is to be noted, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt doth not here giue vnto <hi>Peter</hi> the power of binding and loſing, but only promiſeth to giue it him, which he performed after his reſurrection. <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. in which place he giueth like power to all his Diſciples, ſaying: <hi>Receiue yee the holy Ghoſt, to whom ſoeuer you ſhall forgiue their ſinnes, they ſhall be forgiuen, and looke whoſe ſinnes yee retaine, they ſhall be retained.</hi> Now to vnderſtand how farre the gift of any charge extendeth it ſelfe, we muſt not ſo much reſpect the promiſes made, as the actuall donation, and the maner how it is receaued.</p>

                        <pb n="464" facs="tcp:11466:238"/>onely alleadgeth <hi>Hilary,</hi> which is to bring in mans teſtimony againſt God: and yet hee ſpeaketh not any thing that eyther contradicteth the Goſpell or vs, for he onely ſaith, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> is the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, and that he hath the Keyes, but he ſaith not that he hath them more then the reſt of the Apoſtles. And if that <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> acknowledge that the Keyes are giuen to all the Apoſties, let him ſhew me in what place of ſcripture: for there is not any place in the Goſpell, that ſpeaketh of the giue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of keyes but this onely: and here is no ſpeech made of two kindes of giuing the keyes.</p>
                     <p>Beſides it is eaſie for vs to proue, that the Pope doth vniuſtly diminiſh the power of the Keyes, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to all Biſhops and Prieſts; for ſince they be all Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, they ought to haue the ſame Keyes which the Apoſtles had. Whence it followeth, that God ſaith to all the faithful Paſtors of the Church, in the perſon of the Apoſtles, That whatſoeuer they ſhal binde on earth ſhalbe bound in heauen. But the Pope correcteth this, and ſayth vnto them, whatſoeuer you loſe ſhall not be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound; for there are certaine great offences which are called Caſes reſerued: the abſolution whereof lyeth not in your power, but is a priuiledge peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar vnto me. Vnderſtand now what theſe greeuous ſinnes are, that are thus reſerued to the Pope, Is it Paricide, Inceſt, treaſon againſt Princes, murder, or blaſphemy againſt God? No ſuch matter; that is euer pardoned by euery Biſhop; for ſuch ſinnes are but againſt the law of God: but the ſinnes that
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:11466:238"/>be out of their power are theſe;<note place="margin">See the Bull <hi>de caena Domini</hi> which is of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes reſerued to the pope.</note> If any man hinder them that goe to Rome for Pardons, if any man be an intruder into any Benefice, or office Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, if any haue purloyned the goods of the Church, or if any haue offended the Sea Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call; the abſolution of ſuch horrible ſinnes as theſe are, is no where elſe to be had, but at Rome: Theſe are the caſes reſerued. For, to offend the Pope, or to bereaue him of his profite, is matter farre more heynous then to offend againſt the Maieſty of God. And in the booke of the Penitentiary Taxe, in the chapter of Abſolutions, the falſifying of Letters Apoſtolical, is taxed at ſeuenteene groats, whereas for a man to company with his mother, but at fiue groates onely.</p>
                     <p>Seeing then that about this inequality of the Keyes, which giueth a ſuperiority to <hi>S.

                     <p n="4">4 But cheefely that which <hi>Paul</hi> addeth is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of conſideration, that the charge of preaching to <hi>thoſe of the vncircumciſion was in as large a maner committed vnto him, as that of the circumciſion was vnto Peter:</hi> See here how they parted the labour betwixt them; it fel vnto <hi>S.

                     <p>For their laſt aſſault and encounter, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the wordes of Ieſus Chriſt vnto <hi>Peter, Feede my Lambes;</hi> which wordes they haue made won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull fruitfull, and full of many conſequences: for thus they expound them, <hi>Thou Peter and thy Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours, Popes of Rome, feede you alone all my lambes, and doe you take vpon you a ſoueraignty ouer all other Pastors.</hi> How many ſtrange and venterous Gloſſes are here on the Text? And how haue they peeced out this latchet, to make it reach home? For though Ieſus Chriſt doe expreſly commaund <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to feede his ſheepe, yet he excludeth not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtles: They are all called Paſtors: and all faithfull Biſhops and Miniſters, are enioyned to feed the Church of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. True it is that <hi>S. Peter</hi> was Paſtor of all the ſheepe of Ieſus Chriſt throughout the world, but ſo were likewiſe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtles: For <hi>S.

<pb n="468" facs="tcp:11466:240"/>And why doth he rehearſe the ſame wordes vnto him thrice? Becauſe he had denied the Lord three times: as many fals, ſo many reſtorings: Theſe be not raiſings of him vnto dignity, but ſtrengthnings of his infirmity. As ſaith <hi>S.

                     <p>In the meane time, albeit all the Apoſtles had a generall care ouer all Churches, yet this doth not hinder, but that each of them might haue a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar charge, beſides their generall: <hi>S. Paul</hi> was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with inſtructing the Gentils, and <hi>S. Peter</hi> with teaching the Iewes, and it appeareth not that this his commiſſion was at any time changed, and that in ſtead of being the ſpeciall Teacher of the Iewes, he was made Biſhop of Rome. Beſides that, his dwelling at Rome could not well haue ſorted and agreed with the teaching of the Iewes,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Act.</hi> 18.11.</note> who now were baniſhed from Rome vnder <hi>Claudius</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, which was the very time of <hi>S.

This was ſomewhat too farre from his Biſhopricke of Rome, and nothing ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the dignity of the Monarch of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Church.</p>
                     <p>We will not here contend whether <hi>S. Peter</hi> were euer at Rome: for albeit this Hiſtory be full of
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:11466:240"/>darkneſſe, yet I am enclyned to beleeue, that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Martyrdome at Rome, becauſe <hi>Tertullian, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,</hi> and others doe affirme the ſame: But yet the day-light is not more cleare, then it is euident that ſtayed there but a very ſmall time, and not twenty fiue yeares, as our aduerſaries doe calculate. One proofe ſhall ſerue to be added to thoſe which are alleadged by others.</p>
                     <p>We graunt then that <hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi> did ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Martyrdome at Rome, vpon one and the ſame day, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> and ſome others affirme. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, we will ſhew moſt plainly, that <hi>S. Peter</hi> had not yet beene at Rome three yeares before his death. For <hi>S. Paul</hi> being to depart from Corinth to goe towards Ieruſalem, wrote an Epiſtle to the Romanes, as appeareth by the ſubſcription of his Epiſtle dated from Corinth; and by the fiue and twentieth verſe of the fifteenth Chapter, <hi>Now I goe vp to Ieruſalem.</hi> His voyage to Ieruſalem is deſcribed in the 18, 19, and 20. chapters of the Acts vnto the 15. verſe of the 21. chapter: Seauen dayes after his arriuall he is taken, and to auoyd the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Iewes, he appealeth vnto <hi>Caeſar:</hi> when he came to Rome he preached there two yeares, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.30. and there ſuffered Martyrdome, as we may eaſily gather out of the 2. <hi>Timothy,</hi> Chapter 4. <hi>verſe</hi> 6. and by the ſubſcription of the Epiſtle. From whence it appeareth, that the Epiſtle to the Romanes could not be written aboue three yeares before his death: and not to be too ſtrict, let vs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that it might be 4. yeares: let vs now ſhew, that
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:11466:241"/>
                        <hi>S. Peter</hi> had not beene at Rome, when <hi>S. Paul</hi> wrote this Epiſtle; for that is prooued by the fifteenth chapter of the ſaid Epiſtle to the Romanes, where <hi>Saint Paul</hi> ſaith that he is reſolued to goe to Rome, whereof he rendreth this reaſon, to wit, <hi>I ſtudy to ſet forth the Goſpell, not in thoſe places where mention hath beene already made of Ieſus Chriſt, to the end</hi> (faith he) <hi>that I build not vpon another mans foundation.</hi> He preſuppoſeth then that neyther <hi>S. Peter</hi> nor any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, had till that time, laid nay foundation in the Church of Rome, otherwiſe <hi>S. Paul</hi> going thither ſoone after, ſhould haue built vpon anothers ground-worke. The renowne and credite, and the mutual conference and conuerſation of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſtrangers with the Romanes had ſowen the Chriſtian Religion at Rome: but before <hi>S. Pauls</hi> comming thither, there was not any forme of a Church gouerned, <hi>S. Paul</hi> laid the firſt foundation as is manifeſt by the place alleadged.</p>
                     <p>This being thus gained, let vs end the reſt of the combat: The Kings Maieſty of England hath adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly noted, that the Apoſtle <hi>S.

                     <p>Whoſoeuer would here heape vp places, in which both the Pope and his flatterers attribute vnto him, that he is aboue the law and aboue all right; and that he may diſpenſe againſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, nay againſt the Goſpell it ſelfe: that likewiſe he hath power to diſpenſe with oathes made vnto God, and a thouſand things of the like nature, whereby he ſetteth himſelfe aboue God; might well of theſe things compoſe a great volume, and grieue the heart of the godly Reader, who is tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with a zeale of Gods houſe: But this ſhall ſuffice to ſhew that <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> wrongeth the Pope much in ſaying, that he is called God onely in that ſenſe that Princes are, that is to ſay, for ciuill conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations:

Now in this <hi>Cyprian</hi> goeth about to ſoften and to gratifie the Biſhop of Rome, to the end to prepare him the better to taſte, and to brooke the checkes and reproofes which afterwards he adioyneth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he proueth to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that he hath no power at all ouer Affricke, and that he neither could nor ought to receiue the cauſes of thoſe whom the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of Affricke had condemned: for (ſaith he preſently after) <hi>ſeeing it is ordered among vs all, and that it is a thing iuſt and reaſonable, that euery mans cauſe ſhould be examined where the crime was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that vnto euery Paſtor there is allotted a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the flocke, which each one ought to gouerne, and leade, as being to render an account vnto the Lord of his carriage and behauiour: there is no reaſon, that thoſe whom we guide ſhould runne from one place to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and through their fraudulent raſhneſſe, ſeeke
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:11466:250"/>to breake the concord of Biſhops friendly knit together: but that they ſhould there pleade their cauſes, where they may haue accuſers and witneſſes of their crimes, leſt it fall out that ſome deſperate and forlorne perſons ſhould thinke, that the authority of the Biſhops of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke, who haue condemned them, ſhould be leſſe then others, their cauſe hath beene alreadie examined, the ſentence hath beene alreadie pronounced.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, he maintaineth that <hi>Cornelius</hi> may not take knowledge of any cauſes determined by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of Affrica without accuſing them of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and vuſtaydneſſe, and ſo trouble the peace and quiet of the Church. This is the cauſe that made <hi>Cyprian</hi> to gild his pill, &amp; to extol the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church of Rome, before he would ſhew him, that he ought not to thruſt himſelfe into the affaires of other Churches.</p>
                     <p>For it is diligently to be noted, that thoſe among the ancient Fathers, that affirme that the Biſhop of Rome is ſucceſſour to <hi>Peter,</hi> doe thereby vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that he is ſucceſſour in the charge of Biſhop of Rome, but not in the Apoſtleſhip. After this ſort alſo the Biſhops of Epheſus were ſucceſſors to S. <hi>Iohn</hi> and S. <hi>Paul:</hi> the Biſhops of Ieruſalem ſucceſſors to S. <hi>Iames,</hi> ſo farre as theſe Apoſtles were Biſhops of Epheſus and Ieruſalem: but they neuer were ſucceſſors to the Apoſtleſhip, and to the gouernment of the Church Vniuerſall. Nor is there any reaſon why the Biſhop of Rome ſhould be ſucceſſor to <hi>Peter</hi> in his Apoſtleſhip; and yet the Biſhop of Ieruſalem ſhould be onely ſucceſſor to
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:11466:250"/>S. <hi>Iames</hi> in his Biſhoppricke. Beſides, the Biſhop of Antioch, more auncient then the Biſhop of Rome, hath alwaies beene called the ſucceſſor of S. <hi>Peter:</hi> and why ſhould it not be aſwell in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip and gouernment of the Vniuerſall Church? If you will ſay that <hi>Peter</hi> hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the prerogatiue and preheminence from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, and hath tranſported it to Rome, we vtterly deny it; and thereof no proofe worthy the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing can be brought.

                     <p>We graunt then willingly, that the auncient Biſhops of Rome, before the corruption of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and vſurpation of the Monarchie in the Church, were ſucceſſors of S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricke of Rome onely, euen as the Biſhop of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth was ſucceſſor to <hi>S. Paul:</hi> but withall we adde this, that through the corruption of Doctrine which hath by little &amp; little crept into the Church of Rome (euery age hauing added and contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto) hee is now wholy and iuſtly falne from that ſucceſſion. For he may not in no wiſe be called <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor, who oppugneth the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine preached by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and who in the Chaire of verity doth eſtabliſh a lie. The Turke may not bee called ſucceſſor to the Emperour of Greece, albeit he be ſeated in his place, ſeeing that he is rather his ſubuerter. I would haue one ſhew me that euer S. <hi>Peter</hi> preached any other purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt: or any other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the iuſtice of God, then his obedience: any other ſacrifice propitiatory, then his death. That euer he gaue pardons for an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:11466:251"/>yeares, or drew ſoules out of Purgatory with buls and indulgences: that he euer degraded Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours: that he tooke away from the people the reading of the holy Scriptures, or the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Cup: or that he commaunded the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Images, and publique Seruice to bee ſaid in an vnknowne tongue: or that he euer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned other Biſhops to take from him letters of Inueſtiture, and to pay vnto him Annates: Or that euer <hi>S. Peter</hi> was called God on earth, the Spouſe of the Church, and cauſed himſelfe to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: or that euer he ſung Maſſe, or commaunded the Hoſt to be adored: or that euer he left off prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Goſpell, or quitted the Croſier-ſtaffe, to take vnto him a triple Diaderne: If, I ſay, they can ſhew me that <hi>S. Peter</hi> euer did theſe things, then though the Pope were Biſhop but of one Village alone, I will willingly acknowledge him for <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Succeſſor, but ſtill in the Biſhopricke only, and not in the Apoſtleſhip, which ended in his perſon, and is not deriued vnto his Succeſſors in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches.</p>
                     <p>THus doth the confeſſion of the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands faith remain firme and vnſhaken, againſt which <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> hath armed himſelfe with humane teſtimonies, being vtterly deſtitute of any authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty out of the booke of God. For as they that are ready to drowne, catch hold on any thing, ſo theſe men in a deſperate cauſe embrace all defences, but leaſt of all, thoſe that be good. Againe, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:11466:252"/>this Doctor alleadgeth out of the Fathers, is found to be eyther falſe, or clipt, or vtterly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit. This payment is not currant, eſpecially to ſuch a Prince who hath conſecrated his penne to the defence of the truth. But this is not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to <hi>Coeffeteaus</hi> diſability, but to the vnlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the cauſe, vnto which we haue in ſuch ſort ſatisfied, as whoſoeuer ſhall examine my worke, he ſhall finde an anſwere to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> booke alſo, which he hath not long ſince made againſt the ſaid booke of the King of great Britaine, with more weakeneſſe and leſſe dexterity then <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> hath done.</p>
                     <p>There remayneth the laſt part of his Maieſties booke, wherein with a ſtraine of admirable wit, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by the ſpirit of God, hee openeth the booke cloſed with ſeuen ſeales: and piercing into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of ſacred Propheſies, he findeth in the ſeat of Rome the full accompliſhment of the Apocalyps. When hate and bitterneſſe ſhall be extinguiſhed through time, Poſterity ſhall admire both the worke and the perſon, and looking backe into ages paſt for the like patterne, ſhall not be able to finde any thing to be compared with it. We will not feare then to enter into theſe darkeneſſes vnder ſo great a guide: for it is hard eyther to ſtumble or to ſtray, where ſo faire a Torch doth light and ſhine before vs. But we muſt here take breath a while before we enter into this taske: For the ſudden death of our King like a great cracke of Thunder benummeth our handes with aſtoniſhment, and
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:11466:252"/>troubleth our ſpirits with griefe and anguiſh. Let vs then giue place to neceſſity, and leaue to write, that we may haue leiſure to lament: and let Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity carefully bethinke it ſelfe of remedies, and hold it for a thing moſt certaine, that hee that ſetteth light by his owne life, is maſter of another mans; and that there is nothing ſo forcible to make vs to contemne our owne liues, as this new doctrine, which by the murther of Kings openeth the way to the Kingdome of heauen.</p>
